bella no why

bella okay you remember jacob black
angela ah edward's jealous

flowers on bella's chest the vampiress catches the scent and spins toward her ravenous
as the taha akiwolf leaps onto the vampiress tearing her apart bella lay dying her expression
ext la push behind jacob's house night
back on bella emotions conflicting as she sees all this from the wolves point of view
off bella and the fire
carlisle and jasper watch with concern emmett is draped over the couch bella and edward
edward newborns
bella what like new vampires
edward in their first few months after the change
bella an army of vampires
edward we're the only clan even close to seattle
edward maybe they're behind it in italy i read aro's mind
edward's vision
tracking edward's face as we enter his memory his environs drop out blackness surrounding
edward he wants me and alice to join him our gifts would shore up his power
a flash of edward and alice each in one of the volturi thrones formerly occupied by marcus
edward he knows we'd never choose him as long as our family is still alive
resume edward present
edward an army could solve that for him
bella takes this in then
bella we can't wait two weeks for graduation you need to change me now
carlisle puts and empathetic hand on bella's shoulder
bella can't argue considers
int bella's house kitchen night
at the table staring at it bella enters dropping her backpack coat

bella swallows her guilt she was about to put him through that and may still then he
bella vo i have to figure out what to tell people
int bella's room night
bella's cocooned in her bed in the dark edward lies next to her her mother's quilt between
bella why i won't be home for christmases why i won't visit why they'll never see me again
edward after a few decades everyone you know will be dead problem solved
bella why are you so against me becoming like you
edward i've told you

edward i know the consequences of this choice you're making i've lived through it and to let you
bella i thought maybe you were afraid that i'll be too different unlike i won't be you know
edward you'll always be my bella
edward pulls away both of them reining in their desire
edward my bella just less fragile
ext bella's house night
bella and jacob walk along the sand jacob seems distracted like he wants to say something but
can't bella's too busy worrying to notice
bella gosh it's so pretty here so alice is planning a big graduation party which you're invited to
jacob scoffs
bella yeah i figured that what
jacob i just wanted to do this differently smoother but now i'm out of time
bella to what

bella stares at him momentarily speechless finally
bella i thought you understood i don't feel that way for you
jacob i don't buy it
bella what don't you buy that's how i feel
jacob you feel something else for me you just won't admit it so i'm not giving up i'm gonna fight
bella well then you're not gonna have to fight for long
jacob you're rushing into it because you're afraid you'll change your mind
bella no i'm not i know what i want
jacob takes her by the arms emotionally charged
jacob you wouldn't have to change for me bella or say goodbye to anybody i can give you more
suddenly spontaneously he kisses her bella pushes against him angrily but he pulls her tighter to
finally bella goes limp drops her arms opens her eyes waiting for him to stop he does lets go
but bella spins back toward him and punches him in the mouth there's a horrible crunch on
impact jacob doesn't even flinch but bella grabs her hand in pain
bella ow ow
ext bella's house day
bella mad climbs from jacob's car holding her injured hand as edward's volvo screeches to a
stop he gets out moves directly for jacob bella gets in his path
bella not here edward please
edward if you ever touch her against her will again
bella don't do this
jacob she's not sure what she wants
bella don't do this
edward well let me give you a clue
jacob wait for her to say the words
edward fine and she will
bella jacob just go okay
but jacob faces off with edward behind them charlie exits sees the hostility between them
jacob i kissed bella and she broke her hand punching my face
edward looks on with concern as carlisle finishes setting bella's hand in a splint rosalie at the
emmett trying to walk and chew gum at the same time again bella
bella i punched a werewolf in the face
bella tough enough to take you on
rosalie slaps down the newspaper and abruptly walks out throwing a fierce scowl bella's way
bella is thrown
edward okay any leads
edward alice can keep tracking her decisions but we have to track her on the ground
tired of being ignored bella heads out to the deck
edward we'll searc the northwestern trail
the sun sets over the river as rosalie looks out bella exits rosalie knows who's behind her
bella okay rosalie i don't understand what i did to make you hate me so much
rosalie i don't hate you i don't particularly like you but bella i envy you
bella what that's ridiculous
bella my life is not miserable it's not perfect but nobody's life is perfect
bella it was a long time ago maybe you're forgetting the bad
she turns toward the river bella slowly move to her side
bella reels at the horror of rosalie's asault empathy fills her as a stoic rosalie continues
bella i'm sorry
other end of the hall as it nears we realize it's rosalie in her wedding dress
rosalie is silent for a beat bella turns to her empathetic but holding her ground
bella i understand that's what you want but there's nothing i'll ever gonna want more than
edward
seeing her point has landed rosalie walks off bella shaken turns back toward the house
sees edward standing in the window looking out at her
loud hoots and hollers from the audience in which we find bella jessica's words are sinking in
off bella knowing there will be no changing her mind once she makes her decision the speech
on the stage bella walks to the school principal and shakes his hand while receiving her
charlie and bella walk away bella awkwardly shouldering out of her gown and mortarboard ad
charlie wraps an arm around bella's shoulder emotional
bella dad that's not true
off bella
angle on the front door as bella enters immediately overwhelmed by the crowd she
weaves her way through the throngs searching for edward she finally spots him
bella's pov through the kitchen door
edward is deep in consultation with carlisle emmett and jasper their mood is intense
bella heads toward them but jessica and angela swoop in
bella no you pretty much nailed it
to the atmosphere in the kitchen a dance floor is bella's idea of hell but she forces a smile
bella's pov on the front door
jacob enters calm confident quil and embry flank him looking tense eyes darting around the
room bella maneuvers off the dance floor and into jacob's path
bella what are you doing here

having a vision alarm clouds bella's face jacob see it

the party continues inside but outside the discussion is tense bella alice edward jasper and
carlisle debate as jacob tries to follow quil and embry are nearby on guard

angle on arriving volvo as it skids to a halt next to jasper's jeep edward and bella climb
out head into the field together halfway across edward stops
edward they're here
edward they don't trust us enough to be in their human forms
bella sees the redbrown wolf as it turns toward her
bella jake
he seems to almost smile tongue lolling a sharp look from samwolf gets jacobwolf to focus
edward nods carlisle moves slowly towards their pack samwolf the biggest and blackest steps
edward hey jake welcome
edward they want to know how the 'newborns' is differ from us
bella is taken aback by jasper's skill and there's an impressed rumble among the watching
edward and carlisle attack one another but edward can read carlisle's mind which gives him the
angle on bella anxiously wathcing these firece life and death wr games a portent of the
a furry muzzle brushes her face jacobwolf is beside her his eyes conveying concern she
bella some of you are gonna get hurt some of you could get klled because of me it's gonna be

dirt off bella looks at him as if for the first time
bella jasper are you sure there's nothing i can do to help
bella good i'm glad hey how do you know so much about this
bella's pov close on jasper's arm
with hundreds of white halfmoon shaped scars bella is aghast
bella those bites are like mine
bella this has happened during the civil wr
bella until
back on jasper who stops walking the painful memory washing over him bella moves to a
bella maria was creating an army
alice tries to kiss the ghosts away off bella taking it all in
ext bella's house night
push in on the second story bella's darkened window
find bella back in the field only now she's alone camera circles around her until it's over her
she lunges for bella but for once instead of running she faces her enemy and swings
int bella's room night
on bella in bed midswing edward catches her fist she was dreaming but the fist was real
her eyes focus realizing she swung at edward her heart is racing
edward what is it
bella the intruder the newborn army they're all her puppets victoria
edward alice would've seen if she wanted to make an army
bella unless she's hiding behind them and she's letting someone else decide maybe she found out
edward rises considering
edward trust me i want it to be her i want her that close to end her myself with my own
ext bella's house day
edward exits with bella on his heels
bella i'm not just gonna hide while you're taking all the risks for me
edward if it's victoria involved i need to keep you as far away from the fight as possible
bella jasper said that i could be of help
edward we won't need your help with the wolves in this it's an easy win the rest of us aren't
bella okay either it's so dangerous that i have to hide or it's so easy that you're gonna be side
edward it's dangerous for you it's easy for us
bella i think it's dangerous for us to be apart how many times we have to prove that i'll be
edward okay you're right
bella so i'm coming with you
edward no we've got to stay away together
bella i can't make you choose between me and your family it's
edward the only way i can protect you is to be with you
jacob faces bella and edward they're in the center of the field jasper stands several paces
behind edward
jacob you're not fighting what you pull a muscle or something
bella he's doing it for me okay
jacob looks at her at edward shakes his head with disdain
jacob whatever just tell me the plan
jasper this field will give us an advantage in battle we need to lure the newborns with bella's
bella edward and i are going on a campsite even if he carries me they'll still pick up our scents
edward your stench however is revolting
jacob dude you really don't want to start comparing stinks
bella what he means is that your scent will mask mine if you carry me
jacob done
edward this is not a good idea
jasper edward they won't want to get anywhere near his odor
bella okay let's just try it
edward finally nods she extends her arms to jacob he grins picks her up holding her tight
jacob eau de wolf comin' up

jacob runs through the trees carrying bella not superhuman speed but fast and not breaking a
sweat some time has passed and jacob sets bellla down they start to walk circling back slowly
jacob you gonna ask me to sit out the fight too or don't you care about my safety
bella of course i care but you'd say no
jacob so i won't have a choice anyways since i let sam be alpha male i got to live with the shts
bella since you let sam be alpha
jacob i didn't want to be in a pack let alone be it's their leader
bella wow chief jacob
jacob opted out but every choice has it's consequences some more than others
bella don't start everybody makes choices you gonna have to accept mine
jacob you can love more than one person at a time i've seen it with sam emily and leah
bella well i'm not a wolf i can't imprint
jacob it has nothing to do with imprinting it has to do with feeling something for somebody
jacob pulls her closer indeed making her a little nervous
bella jake
jacob don't worry i promised i wouldn't kiss you again until you asked
bella you're going to be keeping that promise for a while chief

bella it's not modern it's ancient
edward i'm from a different era things were a lot less complicated and if i met you back
he slides off the bed still holding her hand push in on bella's face as
edward i would've courted to you we'd have taken chaperoned strolls or had iced tea on the

edward the newborns will be frantic now let me put a bandage on that
bella it's okay don't make yourself uncomfortable
edward it doesn't bother me anymore
bella since when
edward since i spent 24 hours thinking you were dead

bella i think we should wait to tell him i mean at least till after the fight
edward if you're having second thoughts
bella i'm not i just want him to have a clear head
jacob oc whose head is unclear
they spin to find jacob across the clearing he approaches
bella nobody's i hope
edward and jacob nod curtly to one another jacob eyes the cloudy sky edward does the same
edward alice says there's a storm coming
jacob yeah i can feel it we should get going
edward i'll take the longer route but i'll get there first set up camp
jacob nods edward turns to bella searing her face for ambivalence or surety finally he kisses
edward i'll see you in a couple of hours
he grabs her bag and some gear leaves jacob eyes bella
jacob something up
bella a bunch of vampires trying to kll me
jacob same old same old
jacob runs with bella maintining a steady jog effortlessly carrying her weight she holds onto
back on jacob carrying bella climbing the mountainside going up and up
intercutting ends as jacob and bella reach
jacob bella reach the peak where edward waits near the tent
snow falls in earnest now glacial winds blow jacob sets bella down they hurry to the left side
of the peak to find a campsite erected against the sheltering face of the peak edward stands
by the tent pacing waiting he's acutely relieved to see her he hugs her turns to jacob
edward thank you
jacob nods bella turns to jacob as well
bella you should get back before the storm hits
jacob no i'm staying you'll need my connection to the pack to keep tabs on what's going on
edward looks down nonetoohappy but knowing jacob's right
bella you're not going to fight
jacob seth will spell me in the morning he's not happy about missing the action but it'll keep him
edward notes her disappointment be he covers guiding her toward the tent
edward let's get you inside
int edward and bella's tent same
a lantern burns bella's wrapped in her down sleeping bag fully dressed but her teeth still
edward i should have chosen a site lower down
bella no it's fine i'm okay
edward what can i do
int edward and bella's tent same
suddenly the front zipper opens to reveal jacob
jacob i can't sleep with all that teeth chattering going on
jacob starts to climb into the tent edward reads his mind
edward forget it
jacob she may need her toes someday and let's face it i'm hotter than you
jacob begins to crawl to bella's side but edward's hand is suddenly hard on his shoulder jacob's
jacob get your hand off me
edward get your hands off her
bella don't fight
edward sees her severe discomfort he very reluctantly pulls his hand away jacob looks at him in
jacob she gets sick it's on you
edward debates then makes a hard choice he nods jacob climbs into the sleeping bag next to
bella edward seethes
jacob why you're freezing bella relax you'll warm up soon faster if you took your clothes off
bella jake

edward glares but quickly sees that bella shivering begins to lessen and the relief of warmth
sweep over her off edward envious
on bella no longer shaking her eyelids are losing the fight against sleep include jacob
spooned behind her resting on one elbow facing edward across the tent edward glares at him
edward can you at least attempt to control your thoughts
jacob i really get under that ice cold skin of yours don't i what are you doubting her feelings for
on bella her eyes flicker open slightly the guys don't see she's awake when edward doesn't

jacob nice so picking through my brain's okay but letting me into yours forget it look i
edward oh good
jacob but she's in love with me too she just won't admit it to herself
edward i can't tell you if you're right
jacob's taken aback by his honesty
jacob then let me ask you something if she chooses me
edward she won't
jacob if she did would you try to kll me
on bella she waits for the answer
edward that's an intriguing idea but no i couldn't hurt her like that
jacob no you'd just turn her into a bloodsucking demon like you
edward i don't want that i never wanted that
jacob so stop her
edward i tried i left
jacob but you gave up too quickly if you'd stayed away another six months i could've made her
edward i have considered that i know you can protect her but you can give her a life a human
jacob yeah that i remember when you thought she was gone that you'd lost her how did
edward there're no words but i wouldn't wash it on anyone jacob this might sound odd but i'm
jacob well if you weren't planning on sucking the life out of the girl i love i might no not
edward has to laugh as we push in on bella's face sleep taking over
jacob vo but she could still change her mind you know
edward vo then i'd let her go
close on bella's face suddenly in bright light
the sun outside illuminates the tent bella is alone
bella climbs out to find a young wolf staring at her sitting on his haunches
bella hi seth
bella where's jacob did he already

she turns as edward rounds the peak joins her
edward he's checking to see if the woods are clear before he goes
bella i'm really sorry about last night i couldn't have been easy on you

bella jake you knew he was listening
edward he deserves to know
which confirms for jacob that it's true he turns strides toward the woods bella starts to run
bella jake stop
edward bella let him

edward sees her desperation he sinks resignedly and heads into the woods disappearing bella
races to jacob
bella jake stop jake please

he grabs her and kisses her his anger melts into passion as the kiss continues bella to her
ext bella's house day bella's fantasy

40's their two grown kids pile out of jacob's car home for a holiday grayhaired charlie and

bella edward
bella you saw

edward it's my fault when i went away i left you bleeding and he stitched you up i can't blame
bella don't you dare blame yourself
edward i just want you to be happy no matter
he stops abruptly turns to see sethwolf loping out of the woods growling edward reads his
seth'sedward's vision
back on edward his expression grave he turns to bella
edward it's starting
they follow the scent of bella's blood but the scent trail ends here they're confused
in slow motion jacobwolf charges into the clearing tackling a newborn going for it's neck
on edward reading sethwolf's mind translating for bella
edward jacob just got there he's good
stay on edward's face as he sees the action through sethwolf's mind camera circles edward as
bella and his surroundings disappear dissolving into
the battle field inside edward's mind
edward stands amidst the fight the action all around him
sam and jacob charge a newborn each wolf grab an arm in the mouths and rip
edward sees a newborn take note of jasper's protective actions edward yells at jasper though he
edward jasper back off you can't be everywhere at watch out
ext mountain campsite back on edward and bella
bella is jasper alright edward
edward don't let them protect each other good go around
suddenly edward stops blinks briefly disoriented as his mind is cutoff from the bttlefield he
bella someone's hurt
edward seth go
bella is it jasper
edward whips bella behind him against a cliff wall and takes a defensive stance in front of her
edward she's close i can hear her thoughts she knew we weren't there but she caught my scent
starts running following edward's scent
edward she knew you'd be with me
bella she found us
edward she's not alone
which is when riley steps out of the woods bella immediately recognizes him is taken aback
riley edges closer watching edward's every move as they both carefully position themselves
edward riley listen to me victoria's just using you to distract me but she knows i'll kll you
edward in fact she'll be glad she doesn't have to deal with you anymore
victoria emerges from the woods forming a triangle with riley bella and edward at the apex
edward i can read her mind so i know what she thinks of you
edward she only created you and this army to avenge her true mate james it's the only thing she
riley focuses back on edward positioning himself to attack victoria's eyes burrow into bella's
edward think about it you're from forks you know the area that's the only reason she chose
riley charges toward edward who doesn't move because he knows
riley on the defense edward starts toward
victoria she backs toward the trees edward sees she's about to escape darts into her path
edward you can escape you always do but you won't get another chance like this again
edward you want her you want me to feel the pain you felt when i klled james when i tore him
victoria finally erupts and charges bella
but edward never lets her get close he intercepts her and they roll down the hill in a death
on bella watching this battle desperate to help
meanwhile riley kicks sethwolf hard against the cliff sharp shards of rock fall around bella
sethwolf battered goes down riley spins toward bella
edward now has to protect bella from both vampires and he does with impressive skill with
bella's pov on edward riley tackles him to his knees victoria grabs edward from behind
time freezes slow motion as bella's eyes meet edward's
close on bella's face see her clarity she's never in her life been more sure of what she wants
bella plunges the shard downward stabbing her arm blood immediately flows dripping bright red
on riley spinning toward bella the scent making him wild
on victoria catching the smell her head whips toward bella
edward seizes the moment dead drops to the ground while flipping victoria over his head
edward spins on riley who's still bedazzled by the blood
edward tosses the arm aside and bolts back to victoria
as bella tears her shirt to create a makeshift bandage
edward charges victoria the two clash and begin a blurred battle until he pummels her down
victoria struggles bella is directly in her eyeline she glares at bella who glares back every bit
edward's lips are at victoria's neck it looks as if he kisses her he bites a huge chunk from her
as bella watches victoria's body crumple to the ground
a long beat then edward looks up at bella their eyes meet but shame fear cloud his face she
bella edward
edward i didn't want you to see that
edward i'll get some bandages for your arm
he starts for the tent but sethwolf lets out a sharp bark edward turns his expression fills with
bella something's wrong
edward alice needs us to go and now
bella why what's happening
edward and bella race out of the trees beelining for alice and the rest of the cullens gathered
edward how long
bella scans the field for jacob as
edward stops as he sees someone by the fire
edward what's she doing here
bella looks to the fire by which cowers the newborn bree
bella where's jacob
edward there
bella's pov on the treeline clear across the field
jacobwolf emerges bella sighs with enormous relief he sees her as well starts toward her
on edward with the cullens he can't see the conflict but he can hear it in his mind
edward leah don't
jacob leaps on the male newborn tackling him they roll into the clearing where jacob
but the male newborn gets his arms around jacob and crushes him jacob howls in agony
bella sees this from afar
bella jacob
to release jacob who crumples to the ground as they pull him apart
edward and carlisle appear at jacob's sisde
on bella racing across the field to reach jacob
on jacob as transforms into a human naked grotesquely twisted and broken barely able to
breathe carlisle quickly examines him as he writhes in pain edward steadies him gripping his
edward hold on carlisle is gonna take care of you
jacob in excruciating pain squeezes edward's hand
bella reaches them dropping to her knees beside jacob she strokes his face trying to comfort
jacob bella
bella jake i'm right here
leah jacob you idiot i had it
edward we need to get him out of here we're not gonna win a fight with the volturi
bella hang in there jake we got you
jacob cries out in pain as the pack lift him bella agonizes as she watches them disappear into the
woods she and edward exchange a look of shared concern
the cullens gather in the center of the field converging around bella she sees nothing through
and alec jane asses the scene taking in bella as well
edward if you'd arrived a half hour ago you would've fulfilled your purpose
bree's body bree screams in pain bella flinches esme quickly steps up
esme they came to destroy us to kll bella
edward her name was victoria perhaps you knew her
bree's pain abruptly ceases jane faces edward with an innocent smile that's somehow unnerving
bella plants herself firmly at edward's side the air is tense this could turn bad fast carlisle
carlisle edward if the volturi had knowledge of victoria they would've stopped her isn't that
bella the date is set
jane is ever so slightly taken aback by bella's confidence her look lingers on bella this human
edward stands ready to defend her but jane turns back to felix
off bella fighting revulsion but standing strong with the rest of the cullens as the thick plume
ext jacob's house night
bella's truck pulls up she hurriedly climbs out
as she reaches the porch a loud yell of excruciating pain emanates from inside the house jacob
bella flinches feeling the pain herself they all do
bella reacts to the horror of that leah paces
him off bella as she heads inside
int jacob's room night
bella quietly enters to find jacob lying in bed the entire right side of his body is in a series of
braces bella can't bear to see him this way
bella hey jake
jacob hey i was worried about you
bella you were worried about me
jacob yeah i guessed edward would read my thoughts was he hard on you
bella he wasn't even mad at me or you
jacob well damn he's better than i thought
bella he's not playing a game
jacob right bella he's not as perfect as you think
bella i know who he is i must not talk about that
jacob i'd rather get all the rebreaking done at once
bella i'm sorry jake but it's like sam imprinting on emily i never had a choice with edward
jacob that's crap you're not a wolf remember
bella still it's what it is
jacob at least i know i did everything i could wasn't easy making you admit your feelings for me
bella i only fought them because i know they wouldn't change anything
jacob i'm exactly right for you bella it would be as easy as breathing with me
bella you know i love you
jacob you know how much i wish it was enough
bella should i come back
jacob i need some time but i'll always be waiting
bella until my heart stops beating
jacob maybe even then
rapprochement off bella grateful for this tiny opening he's left her
luminescent edward and bella lie in the grass her head on his chest

edward sits up looks her in the eyes
edward i just don't know why you're doing this
bella what the wedding
edward you're trying to make everyone else happy but you're already giving away too much
bella you're wrong
bella this wasn't a choice between you and jacob it was between who i should be and who i am
bella i've always felt out of step like literally stumbling through my life i'm never felt normal
edward so it's not just about me
bella no sorry
bella i've made a mess trying to figure all this out but i wanna do it right and i wanna tie my
edward starting with a wedding
bella actually something a little more difficult first and maybe even dangerous we have to
edward it's highly dangerous
bella it's a good thing you're bulletproof i'm gonna need that ring
edward smiles pulls the black box from his pocket he removes the ring takes her left hand in
it is against this beautiful romantic backdrop that edward slips the ring onto bella's finger
