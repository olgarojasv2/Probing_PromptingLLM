(INSERT – THE SPARKLING RING – a long oval face with slanting rows of glittering stones, set within  a fragile web of gold.)
 Edward: This was my mother's.
 (The beautiful ring literally takes Bella's breath away. Edward pulls her to her feet as he remains on his knees. Fear and love do battle within her as--)
 Edward: Isabella Swan. I promise to love you, every moment forever. And would you do me the extraordinary honor of marrying me?
 (As he slips the ring on her finger, she is overcome. Tears spring to her eyes as, finally, love wins  out...)
 Bella: Yes.
