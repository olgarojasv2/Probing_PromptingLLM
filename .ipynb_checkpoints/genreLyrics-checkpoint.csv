76301	Rock	"Hey, if you were right I'd chase away
All the reason for my old desire to change
But the right words, don't improvise the ideals
My body sails into a passage waiting in vain
It might just be so uninviting, is it comical
From until now I've gone to something else
I'll never forget how I once saw myself
If not for the way I'd changed, if not for the way
Say, every hour is always the same
Gazing endlessly to the usual clouds I'd always collect
As the town slips with the hatfull by the sunset
And paralyze the aspirations of the day
The rightous become the silenced
The fallen ones, they'll never find that road that's fallen them
I'll never forget how I once saw myself
If not for the way I'd changed, if not for the way
It's not quite the same
I'll never forget how I once saw myself
If not for the way I'd changed, if not for the way
It's not quite the same"
293332	Rock	"There's something about the way we fit
There's something about this psycho trip
There's something about the way we groove
Something's got me and I just can't seem to choose
I want you
I hate you
The one I love I hate
But the sex is great
The one I love I hate
But the sex is great
The one I love I hate
So I contemplate
The one I love I hate
But the sex is great
There's something about the way we slide
There's something about this psycho ride
There's something about the things we do
Something's got me and I just can't seem to choose
I want you
I hate you
The one I love I hate
But the sex is great
The one I love I hate
But the sex is great
The one I love I hate
So I contemplate
The one I love I hate
But the sex is great
One, two, fuck you
Never say no
I'm ready to go
We're out of control
But I can't let you go, let you go
There's something about the way we fit
There's something about this psycho bitch
The one I love I hate
But the sex is great
The one I love I hate
But the sex is great
The one I love I hate
I could suffocate
The one I love I hate
But the sex is great
I love to hate you
She know I love to hate you
She know I love to hate you
She know I love to hate you, hate you, hate you

Could be that magic potion

209590	Rock	"I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
'Cause your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone
These wounds won't seem to heal, this pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase
When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
You used to captivate me by your resonating light
Now, I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me
These wounds won't seem to heal, this pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase
When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
But though you're still with me, I've been alone all along
When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
You still have all of me, me, me"

It's that gravy, you know what I'm saying?
This goes out to my beloved Family of Atoms
(That's my word, I love them)
This goes out the Indelible MC's - you know they STAY unmovable
This goes out to Bay of Pigs Hail rock
Power Kingdom, last but not least
Golden Money Clan, You know T-1, a.k.a. Shell Shock, c'mon
And I'm Vast Aire - 'nuff said
Now, let us build upon this issue
If the Highway to Heaven is narrow, then sinners acts as fat tissue
And as one can see, I have no space!
But I remain on the positive scale-weight of the galaxy
What, you wanna fix fallacy?
You can run around the world twice chasin' chastity
What in the Hell possessed you? Don't you know I m Cannibal?
That means when I'm rhyming that I get down to the bone gristle
I start lickin' my fingertips in the cipher
See, naturally, I'm higher than
That's right, above any (any) homegrown
THC Herbal[???]provider
But that's beside the point
Tell me who's gonna hold the weight?
I can't wait any longer
I'm ready to hold plates with Jehovah
Using Neptune's fork, telling Zeus to move over
I'm here before dinner
Clearing the Periodic Table of Elements off
Then I'm supplying a tablecloth
Yo, you can catch me, analog mic hog
I can't feel rhythms without cholesterol
After all, you must learn to
Examine the appetite
Within the nuclei
Within the presence of the omnivore's eye
That is I
And when sunlight shines off my throat
We call it the solarflex larynx lorax smoke
For the trees
This is real life, and I'm Vast Aire
I usually speak for calories[???]
Skinny MC's trying to start somethin'
Bulimic MC's trying to throw something up
I can fondle around the outskirts of diets
A donut at midnight ain't nuttin'
I'm a glutton!
Now let's build upon this issue
If the Highway to Heaven is narrow, then sinners acts as fat tissue
And as one can see, I have no space!
But I remain on the positive scale-weight of the galaxy
What' you wanna fix fallacy?
You can run around the world twice chasin' chastity
And all that - you nah'mean?
It's T-1 and Vast Aire
The bassline is like biscuits and gravy, nah'mean?
Yo I'm Vast Aire, I'm not a hard MC
I'm not a hard MC - I'm Vast Aire
I'm not a hard MC - I'm difficult
I'll stand up brewin' hot pots of piety hip-hop
The gluttony inside of me won't stop
Yo, it won't stop
If you can't have your cake and eat it, you never had it
Anyway, plus it ain't even your birthday gimme that!
Now you cramped up my flow has that ability
You should have waited 30 minutes to press play
Oh, you'e a fad MC? Well if you don't say
You grab at the mic, and all I see is a ribcage
Vast is the vitamin MC you never believed in
So I vanished you, due to malnutrition
MCs are too bloated
Thought they were fat but they only retained water
You know them the sluggish type, they get led to the slaughter
Is you fugeze?
The Ethiopians praise me
The Black god chubby thoughts and a chubby belly
You feelin me? (YEAH!) You feelin me? (YEAH!)
Do you wanna hear a little more? (HELL YEAH!)
The beautiful balance of life
You don't want me to sit on the other end of the see-saw
'Cause you're afraid you might see more
You might see more
T-1, he up on it, you know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, I'm Vast Aire I been on it
Vordul, he up in here... uh, what?

186881	Rock	"He said he'd be here at seven
The clock just hit 7:22
It's too cold outside
To wait for my ride
Watching mama try out a new doo (Bruins)
He said he'd be here at seven
But it just hit 7:35 (already?)
Here in Brockton, Mass.,
I got my thumb in my ass
Mama's combing up a big beehive (Celtics)
Where the fuck is he?
Where the fuck is he?
The bitch doesn't even bother calling
Even though it's 7:44 (I fell asleep, pally)
I'm feeling kinda antsy
Mama's getting fancy
Slicking back a wet pompadour (Red Sox)
He said he'd be here at seven
It's closing in on 8:01 (Trimmin' the 'stache, kid)
Me lookin' like a sap
In a wool knit cap
Mama's next move is a bun (fuckin' Patriots)
Where the fuck is he? (My pants are still in the dryer, dude)
Where the fuck is he? (I couldn't find my fuckin' snowboots, pal)
I wish I had a car (Huge, huge hangover)
Oh, no (Massive hailstorm, massive hailstorm, massive)
That stupid little punk
He's probably fuckin' drunk
I bet he drank a case
Wanna pop him in the face right now
Mama's eyebrow
Wicked good
Wicked good (Oh, GOD)
Wicked good
Wicked good (Fuck yeah)
Wicked good
Wicked good (Pisser?)
Well my friend is still a no-show
And I'm getting' fucking pissed (Why?)
'Cause I could've gone with Charlie
In the side of his Harley
Mama's on the phone with a stylist (Fuck Charlie!)
So I guess I ain't going out tonight
'Cause the digits say 12:09 (Shit-faced)
But call the operator
'Cause one perm later
Mama's hair sure do look fine (Heffenreffer!!!)

MJ, G up in yo shit like some toilet paper
Get fresh wit' me nigga I'ma spoil it later
You'll float backside up in a swamp of gators
Then you'se a snack-sized nigga, formerly a hater
Heavy weighters, street poetry creators
Double-barrel blast for you pimp game perpetrators
Can't touch us, I know you wanna be us
Fake-ass rappers can't fuck wit' what we bust
Whoa, do you really wanna get crunk?
Hey, do you really wanna get buck?
Whoa, do you really wanna get crunk?
Hey, all my players, all my gangstas
Whoa, do you really wanna get crunk?
Hey, do you really wanna get buck?
Whoa, do you really wanna get crunk?
Hey, all my hustlers, all my grinders
Roll through, one deep, heat in the waistband
Jealous-ass niggaz might try and touch a made man
Crazy rap fans, followin' my rap van
Wanna get a hug, wanna shake a playa hand
Smoke somethin', I'm a fiend for the sticky green
My whole team, keep it clean like a pinky ring
Hardcore like a scene in Cabrini Green
Plenty green get a young nigga anything
Excursion, escalade with the big rims
Denim suits, soulja rag with my gold Timbs
Poppin' pills like a nigga eatin' M&M;'s
Shoppin' deals at the table wit the best of them
Leave the rest of them, way in the back
Weak-ass rappers get smoked like a sack
Fat Boy did that, didn't nobody help me
MJ to the G
Do you really wanna get buck?
Then tell the truth, I don't give a fuck
Each day is a blessin', I'ma live it up
Put ya best south fit in the cleaner
Da, da, dun, da, dun, hit the horn like Leana
I never seen a, party crunker than the one I'm in
Bitch pullin' contest we done won again
We hit the scene all the women start swarmin' in
I feel like I died, went to heaven and born again
Pimp tight, MJ fuckin' G
Death wish meant for anybody touchin' me
I'ma hit the dancefloor with a attitude
Who's the killer now? Tell me who's the badder dude?
Who's the one who ain't afraid to let the bullets fly?
If you know you ain't gon' use it, why you pull it why?
Do you really wanna kill me and do time?
And leave ya kids and ya girlfriend left behind?

Whoa, do you really wanna get crunk?
Hey, do you really wanna get buck?

Hey, all my hustlers, all my grinders
Do you really wanna hit the sauna
With some bitches and marijuana?
Sailboats offa the beaches of California
Getcha game tighter as a fist and the ice that's on it
Y'all ain't crunker than us, ghetto performers
Street roamers, still keepin' the heat on us
Corner on a nice day, nigga just thought I'd warn ya
Eightball and MJG, we the buckest
Dope shit nigga, roll us up in the Duchess
One of the hardest niggaz that you will ever meet
Two of the hardest niggaz to bust over beats
It's all real, never fantasy or incomplete
Incomplete emcees just can't compete
Hear defeat, I'm elite when I grab a sheet
Grab a pen and compose what my life hold
Fuck what a nigga stole I'ma still roll
Fifty deep, fifty feet from you weak hoes

I can't be eco conscious, I'm always burning trees
And is there fire, fire, call it that third degree,
And call me supersonic I shake the earth beneath ya
Hell yeah you heard of me it's quite a emergency
The way I take the game and I beat it so un-unmercifully, yeah
Ladies with curly features, wait at concerts to see you
They can roll home with B.O., and maybe service me up
But if you wanna work for me then girl you need your working visas
And if you ain't working then you just should not converse with me
That's not that serious, don't take it so personally
Plus currently I prefer the girls who prefer the three C.P.O.
C.P.O. I think I think I'm Neo
I'm caught up in her Matrix and I think it's time to reload
And if this is what I caught girl I would have to appeal
I think that the defendant have some things that must reveal
Heels ha, heels ha, tell me what's the deal, man
Got me chasing you to see if I could cop a feel, huh
I gotta keep it real, kosher, kosher, kosher
Cause she don't want that bullshit, no sir, no sir, no sir
Her thighs go round like roller-coaster motors
And like a minute bundle, I had to roll them over
Had to plug the headset into her motorola
This bout to get scary like the end of October
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
I got that fire man, and other shit is so so
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
I'm at the fryin pan, your shit is so cold
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
I got that fire man, and other shit is so so
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
I'm at the frying pan, your shit is so cold
So cold like a hobo wearing no clothes and it's snow globe when the temperature is below froze
I mean below freezing and there's no reason to be so cheesy, got my own team and my own league
My own lane and my own speed, it's a long road so I don't sleep
If I don't know you I don't speak, it's a small world and it's gonna shrink
If you're full of shit, then you're gonna stink
I'm a realist I'm gonna think, with a pair of eyes so I'm gonna see
I'll be whatever the fuck I wanna be, I'll be everything except a wanna be
I'll be everything you ever wanna be, if you're clever enough you can corner me
But what's a corner to me, I'm geometry
So tell me who gave you the authority? Who the fuck are you? The authority?
What am I supposed to be orderly? pardon my honor you're charging me?
Saying something I oughta be but I got some much heart that my arteries will always be partying like a camaraderie
Man I'm already famous historically so my story is already glorious
Just like P Diddy victorious to the B.I.G. Notorius,
I'm a champion, I'm a warrior, I bring war to ya,
So if you got beef that's unfortunate, we'll hang ya'll out like portraits
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
I got that fire man, and other shit is so so
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
I'm at the frying pan, your shit is so cold
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
I got that fire man, and other shit is so so

my mirrored room, my secret life
it's lonely here,
there's no one left to torture
Give me absolute control
over every living soul
And lie beside me, baby,
that's an order!
Give me crack and anal sex
Take the only tree that's left
and stuff it up the hole
in your culture
Give me back the Berlin wall
give me Stalin and St Paul
I've seen the future, brother:
it is murder.
Things are going to slide, slide in all directions
Won't be nothing
Nothing you can measure anymore
The blizzard, the blizzard of the world
has crossed the threshold
and it has overturned
the order of the soul
When they said REPENT REPENT
I wonder what they meant
When they said REPENT REPENT
I wonder what they meant
When they said REPENT REPENT
I wonder what they meant
You don't know me from the wind
you never will, you never did
I'm the little jew
who wrote the Bible
I've seen the nations rise and fall
I've heard their stories, heard them all
but love's the only engine of survival
Your servant here, he has been told
to say it clear, to say it cold:
It's over, it ain't going
any further
And now the wheels of heaven stop
you feel the devil's riding crop
Get ready for the future:
it is murder
Things are going to slide ...
There'll be the breaking of the ancient
western code
Your private life will suddenly explode
There'll be phantoms
There'll be fires on the road
and the white man dancing
You'll see a woman
hanging upside down
her features covered by her fallen gown
and all the lousy little poets
coming round
tryin' to sound like Charlie Manson
and the white man dancin'
Give me back the Berlin wall
Give me Stalin and St Paul
Give me Christ
or give me Hiroshima
Destroy another fetus now
We don't like children anyhow
I've seen the future, baby:
it is murder
Things are going to slide ...
When they said REPENT REPENT ..."

Go go east

Too many the questions
Where answers are few

A passage to choose--
The trees growing ripe
With forbidden fruit
Dance in the garden
Sing with the snakes
Inviting free will,
To repeat his mistakes
With hunger unwilling
What will you do
The trees are ripe
With forbidden fruit
Live, love, be, believe
Go go east
Go go east of Eden
Rising in the eastern sky
The sun god dances light divine
Rising in the eastern sky
The western banks below his eye
Live, love, be, believe

You write some words they try to sell
And then you sing these things in public sometimes not very well

Drinking colors, talking trash,
You get laid because you're 'arty'

Maybe these are wonders, more than we may know
Well I hate to steal your thunder
You ain't nothing special
You're no more celestial than anyone else
As far as I can tell
Call it mythology, we see what we want to see
And everyone wants their distant dreams
So sure enough they want your picture
And your deepest point of view
Well you should know you're not that pretty
And you haven't got a clue
But how you love the adoration
You believe your 'in-house' press
And half the critics always hate you
So you get horribly depressed
Maybe these are wonders, more than we may know
Well, I hate to steal your thunder

And the gal who really knew her way around.
There's still talk of that event

She took the town and turned it upside down.
With her red silk stockings and her green perfume
She blew into this man's town with a silver boon.
Never was any trouble but she started some soon
With her red silk stockings and her green perfume.
Oh the town was growin'
And the money was flowin'
And the boys were throwin' it around.
Oh the red silk stockings and the green perfume.
She was singing a love song in the gamblin' hall.
When along came a stranger
He was handsome and tall.
He won every last dollar that we had in the room.
And the red silk stockings and the green perfume.
Oh the town was growin'
And the money was flowin'
And the boys were throwin' it around.
Oh the red silk stockings and the green perfume.
Oh she promised to meet me by the silvery moon.
She was meeting that stranger by the cactus dune.
All she left was a memory of a honky tonk tune.
And her red silk stockings and her green perfume.
Oh the town was growin'
And the money was flowin'
And the boys were throwin' it around.
For the red silk stockings and the green perfume."

West coast
I'm the doctor's advocate
Nigga Dre shot ya
Brought me back from the dead
That's why they call him the doctor
The mavs gon' drop em
If 50 ain't rockin' wit him no more
It's ok, I get it poppin'
The whole club rockin' like da 6-4 Impala
Drink Cris throw it up call the shit hydraulics
Then piss in the cup call the shit Hipnotiq
I bleed Compton, spit crack, the shit chronic
And you new niggas ain't shit but new niggas
Baped n ape shoe niggas I'm talkin' to you nigga
Bounce in the 6-4 throwin' up west side man
Sell another five million albums, yes I am
Fresh like damn dis nigga did it again
A hundred thousand on his neck, LA above the brim
Inside the Lambo', shotgun wit Snoop
What would the muthafuckin' west coast be without
One crip and one blood?
One blood, one blood, one blood
Blood, blood, blood
One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood, one blood
I'm from the west side of the 6-4 Impala
When niggas say, Where you from?
We'll never say holla
Bandana on the right side, gun on the left side
Niggas in New York know how to throw up the west side
Word to Eazy, I'm so ill believe me
I made room for Jeezy
But the rest of you niggas better be glad you breathing
All I need is one reason
I'm the King and Dre said it the west coast need me
I don't know why you niggas keep tryin' me
Everybody know that I'm the heir to the Aftermath dynasty
And I ain't got to make shit for the club
What DJ gon' turn down the 38 snub?
You 38 and you still rappin'? Uhh
I'm 26 nigga, so is the dubs
On the 07 Hummer hop out
Nobody guards, when the chronic
Smoke clear, all you gon' see is one blood
One blood, one blood, one blood
Blood, blood, blood
One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood, one blood
I ain't got beef wit 50, no beef wit J
What's beef when you gettin' head in the 6 trey?
And the double game change, I keep em on display
Black t-shirt so all you see is the A
Turn on the TV and all you see is the A
You niggas better make up a dance and try to get radio play
Keep on snappin' your fingers, I ain't goin' away
I don't regret what I spit, cause I know what I say
And niggas talk about me, they don't know when to stop
I got the Louis Vuitton belt buckle holdin' the glock
No beam, no silencer, I know when to pop
I wait till Lil' Jon come on and let off a shot
I had the number one Billboard spot
Niggas stepped on my fingers and I climbed right back to the top
I'm BIG, I'm Cube, I'm Nas, I'm Pac
This ain't shit but a warning till my album drop
One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood
Blood, blood, blood
One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood, one blood
One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood
Blood, blood, blood"

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop
And told his plans to me, so
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
[Chorus]
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

It's just me without my bike
There's just one thing that I love more than anything
I hold it so near to my heart
It has just one gear and a pair of blue training wheels
A headlight to see in the dark
I like my bike, it's not like other bikes
I like my bike, it's not like other bikes
It has pinwheels and a purple banana seat
Loud cards in the spokes as they bend
It has a big horn that I honk when you're in my way
So I don't run over my friends
I like my bike, it's not like other bikes
I like my bike, it's not like other bikes
I ride my bike to the girl that I like
And she looks at me and my bike
A tear fills her eye as she's filled with great pride
When I ask her to take a ride
Me and my girl, we ride all over town on it
My guide is the street and the sun
We stop for a shake, I pretend we'll share all of it
When I hit the eject button
I like my bike, it's not like other bikes
I like my bike, it's not like other bikes"

great Goliaths who've turned sour
never feeling, never caring
only blindly you're following one flight of power
crushing all who stand there before you
taking breaking you

grind to dust, those who can't pay your due
With careful plans your lies
there's no risk and no mistake
ignore the small man as he cries
smash him and then he'll cooperate
giant stop for a moment
search deep within your heart
are you so sure you're right
you could make a new start
if you left this Earth
who would care
what d'you think you're worth
just a share
you don't have much time
face the truth
you'll pay for your crime
you must choose
there's another way of living
see what you get by giving
take your chance, find your way
take it, while you may
forget that thing called pride
just awaken what's inside
stop deceiving start believing
your humility will be your last misleading guide
the seeking mind could then show you how
freely gladly now
fulfill yourself, be satisfied
give all the love, that you can mend all
with simple joys, your life
will be rich and so much more
welcome the feeling, see it thrive
the peace that you've been searching for"

Still thinks he might

Helping someone make the right choice
He's smiling with my face
He's showing me the way
And I'm so glad that I can be a part
He's living in my heart
With his voice He'd speak
And calm an angry sea
Yet He said that one day
We'd do greater things than He

Got fist full of dollars, and a pocket full of love

Tried to sell my soul but no one's buying
Lord, strike me down now, if I'm lying
It's getting cold, it's time for dying
Come on and watch me shine
Like the world is mine
Today, come on and watch me shine
Like the world is mine
Today, watch me shine
Let man who's free from sin
Cast the first stone and begin the violence
Let man whose words ring true
Speak on up till his voice breaks through the silence
Let the one's who lose their way
Live to see just one more day in the sunshine
Let the one's who chose to stray
Recognize the price they'll pay in their lifetime
Come on and watch me shine
Like the world is mine
Today, come on and watch me shine
Like the world is mine
Today, watch me shine
Sitting here, waiting for my roads to cross
You nailed me down and you watched me bleed
So lay my head against the earth
Plant my body like a seed
You can't always get the things you want, love
Get what you deserve and maybe what you need
So fill my hole with precious dirt, love
Turn the soil and plot the weed
Come on and watch me shine

Today, come on and watch me shine
Like the world is mine
Today, watch me shine"

That you're runing out of fantasies

Whata you're willing to be

What you gonna give me
To ease the pain
When it's all over
Won't know your name

You know you pour in everyone you got
Just to fill the need
No doubt you're witness
To a major scene

But she knows it isn't true

I think she knows bout me and you
Now she cries with silent tension
This can't be right
And the downtown special cries along
'Cause I'm leaving tonight

And I hope she'll be okay
I just pray someone will find her
And guide her along her way

But she'll always be my baby
Though I'm leaving tonight
Every night I hear her
Talking in her sleep
She says Â«You know I'll always be there Â»

Just tell her that I loved her

Madonna, Timberlake, Rihanna and K-Pop
Walking around like a non-cerebral
Love zombie with a taste for love not evil
Like when he said I couldn't make the scene
And I replaced him with a drum machine
She said I'd never find better
But I replaced her with a ...
And later on with someone better better better better
And afterwards when I feel like a cigarette
I hold back 'cause I know you don't like the smell of it
I taking corners in fourth gear
One hand on your thigh, the other just to steer
And unlike you, when I open my mouth
I open my mouth and the suburbs come out
Tantric romantic
I sleep alone in the suburbs tonight
And above me summer birds circle against a pink and blue sky
I think of you on the other side of a continental divide
Sending me photos from your mobile of you smiling
And right then I don't know quite why
But it's more than implied, it's like a flood tide
Inside, outside, inside, best side, worldwide, I sighed
And the world got better better better better"

She was sexy and so innocent, guilty and magnificent,

There was a silence that felt upon the club,
On comes the spotlight and all I could see was her,
We started moving to a heart beat,
You became a part of me (a part of me)

Your so beautiful, like an angel on the dance floor
All eyes are on you girl,
Impossible to make one,
Since I laid eyes on you,

I've done some things I can't explain
I walk the streets alone
The darkness is my safety zone
Yes always
always in the rain
The street lights print my silhouette
upon the pavement dark and wet
I find my childhood in the ghoarts
of the old neighborhood
Yes always
always in the rain.
It's a melancholy feeling
shakes my senses takes my feeling
Then I find i just surrender
to the moment it's so tender
I watch the neon city swirl
just like a mystic dancing girl
Beneath the stormy weather
all those colors flow together
always
always in the rain
My dream to lie again with you
beneath a boundless sky of blue
It's just a fantasy
a wish within a memory
Yes always
always in the sun

to days of laughter in the rain
When all the world seemed new
the future gleamed and love was true
Yes always

Always in the rain

If I knew what's going on, just a part of your plan

In eternal isolation, for the sake of inspiration
And the stuff that dreams are made of
The jester takes the violin
And lets the poison flow
Insects whirr into the sky
& atlas dropped the earth u know
U wrote a 2. comedy
With all the nightmares u could feature
But I'm lying in my own world
Learning from my own world's creatures
If the audience was listening
Just for one more time
I could be more than a clown
Living more than a lie
But while I reel in the spotlights

Can't remember the song

In the silk and amphetamines.""
Johnny looked at my songs, and he said
""Well, at first guess,
Never in my life have I ever seen such a mess;
Why do you say everything as if you were a thief?
Like what you stole has no value,
And like what you preach is far from belief?""

Get this message straight now 'cause I'm sick as shit

The bet was set you know I really don't miss a thing
Cause sometimes the rain is warm in winter
And the clouds part everything
Is clear when I play the card I dealt
The ice will warm and melt
And I don't think I'll care
There's nothing wrong at all with spending time alone
And if I ever have to use the word friend again
Don't question just slap my face
There's no devotion when I played and betrayed
And if there are no starts
Then there'll be no more ends

When I say mankind, I use it as a derogatory term
Whereas scientists and governments use it as a saving grace
Well I once saw Micheal Heseltine on the telly, whilst he was still environment secretary, and it was a U.N. debate called 'The State Of The Planet, Ten Year On.' Ten years on since the last debate, and he's there saying, 'Look folks, don't worry. Everything is under control. The rate of progress is faster than the rate of decline.' As if that made everything OK.
A man who is older than me, with factories in South African says, 'That's the way of the world, and there's nothing you can do about it. You can't change it. So you might as well enjoy it whilst you still can. Well that's what I always say anyway, hmm, yeah, and remember that, that's a damn good outlook on life. I've come a long way I have, I have indeed. In fact, you could say I'm a shining example. The dirty kid come clean. Have a cigar.'
He must be right cos he's got more experience than me. Yeah, he's got a degree in better ways of destroying the earth, better ways of ceasing to be. Even if we forget about nuclear war, just for a minute, only for a minute See he's cutting all the trees down, the atmosphere is breaking down The rain cycle's collapsing, acid rain destroying our lakes. Forest is being cut down at a rate of an area the size of France every year Whole countries of fertile land are being turned into desert, ask him about it, see what he's got to say for himself. Ask him about it, see what he's got to say.

And it's mine, all mine
He's got something
I feel it each time we kiss
And he thrills me
Each time he holds me like this
When we part
Breaks my heart
I miss him so
He's got something
Only lovers know
He's got something
It's so fine
He's got something
Mine, all mine
He's got something
I miss him so
He's got something
Only lovers know
Yeah
He's got something
I don't know what but it's grand
I can feel it each time he touches my hand
When we walk
When we talk
Yeah
I feel so fine

When we part
Breaks my heart

Gotta keep moving for your own protection
Now that kind of love just ain't enough
You turn the tables on my whole world baby
you take away all the heartache bad love gave me
Can't you see what you've done in my life?
And make that pure conection.
Changed ma whole perception of love
You're the fuel in my fire
my fever burns high
don't be scared of desire;
It's a good thing
(chorus)
when we come together,
you can't stop this good thing
No, you can't put it out
when we come together
try to stop this good thing
and it will burn you down
I'm kinda warming to this new sensation
cause everyday is like a revelation
just show me something i never knew about me yeah
my friends can't lead me into no temptation
cause baby you'll give me everything i ever need
fooling you make a fool out of me
(theres not a chance ill take coz ill never have to fake it with you)
there is fuel in my fire
our fever burns high
were not scared of desire its a good thing

Time to break the eternal rejection
To arise from an unhonoured exile
Purposefully leaving the infinite depths behind
The depths of oblivion
The depths of mystery
The depths of obscurity
The depths of eternity
Contaminating the world with death
Ending lives, the way dying was supposed to be
Deceased guided into engless obscurity
Depths of eternity, terminus of the living dead
Set out for an undead journey
Travelling through desolute domains
A sense of frugality dominates the atmosphere

The depths of oblivion, better to forget
The depths of mystery, complete unawareness
The depths of obscurity, infinite darkness
The depths of eternity, no escape from death

Seekin' my fame and fortune, lookin' for a pot of gold

Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again
Rode in on the Greyhound, I'll be walkin' out if I go
I was just passin' through, must be seven months or more
Ran out of time and money, looks like they took my
Friends
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again
The man from the magazine said I was on my way
Somewhere I lost connections, ran out of songs to play
I came into town, a one night stand, looks like my plans
Fell through
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again
If I only had a dollar, for every song I've sung
And every time I've had to play while people sat there
Drunk
You know, I'd catch the next train back to where I live

Pass me my shirt hung on the line.
I'll polish up my boots

It's a handicap to try to see this far,
When this place seems so cramped and small.
In the streets they whisper legends
And it seems that I'm riding for a fall.
I'm leaving,
I'm leaving.
All of my sense is shot,
The streets are like a premonition of a crime.
I wrote without you,
Then I took the first plane stateside I could find.
If they could they would've stopped me,
They'd say I'm gaping at a dream.
I'm leaving,
I'm leaving.
So I polish up my brand new car,
Then take my tunes from door to door.
I try not to see their faces
As I'm dealing out my aces,
The horizon seems so far away.
From a penthouse for a king and queen
I expected more of the stuff of dreams.
If they can they like to get their man
And cut him right down to his knees.
And I'm reeling,
Once again I'm leaving.
I'm leaving
And once again I'm leaving.
And I'm leaving,
Once again I'm leaving."

How long before you heal that pain
How long before you see that train going

Of Aftermath straight out the mothafuckin streets of Compton
Put your hands together for Game bitch
Hahahaha
Yeah mothafuckas
Compton's back on the mothafuckin map
Aftermath in that ass bitch
Game let's go
Me and Marshall ain't start shit they listen to our shit
They talk shit about us but that shit is foul when
I'm tryna feed my son and drop multi-platinum albums
Make my mother proud that her son made it out
But its hard when they hate us and think 'Em a racist
They say shit but fuck them
Shady one of the greatest like Biggie n' Pac was
We saw the throne was empty and decided to chase it
Me, him and 50 racin' this rap shit is basic I followed that Jay shit
Thinkin what I wanna say, step in the booth in one take and
How could I not sell a million when I'm rappin' on Dre hits
Then spit that classical LA, NWA shit
The media is bullshit now we can't even say bitch
They accusin Michael of touchin kids in the wrong places
At first they embraced him, had a couple of face lifts
Now people wanna place him with murderers and rapists
They comin' I can taste this swear to God I ain't racin'
Put the clip in and wast 'em before I go out on that fake shit
I'm so sick and tired this black shit this white shit
So I sit here and write shit, Em they ain't gon' like this
So they callin us
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
This day the game won't ever be the same
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
The game just isn't the same its changing
To new Game
You're now about to witness the power
Only Dre can, judge me for the mistakes I'm making
If I'm faking, I'm Clay Aiken
You ain't 50 and you ain't Game, you lame, you're tame
Bitch you're mild sauce, you ain't ready to make that flame switch
You'll end up in the same situation, same shit
Different day, just with different gangstas in your face
Which- way do you wanna face when your brains hit pavement
Think of what you'll say to Pastor Mase and save it
For the day that they got them affidavits waving in my face
Looking for answers, rap sensation Eminem battles to ward off accusations
That he had somebody blasted
The Mask of Jason was found at the scene of the task with masking tape
And the victim's penis up his ass, a basket case
And they ask him to clean up his act, you bastards wasting too much time
Me no kiss ass, and if that's the case, then we ain't going
So they callin us
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
This day the game won't ever be the same
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
The game just isn't the same its changing
To new Game
You're now about to witness the power
Low get Dre on the phone quick
Tell him Em' just killed me on my own shit
I'm walking through 8 mile, startin' to get home sick
I'mma do Shady numbers, I'm ridin' my own dick
Yeah the chrome sick, the window's tinted
If Eminem is anybody armor under the Pendleton
These niggas is killing it take a minute to listen
Turn down my Jimi Hendrix, I'll throw your demo out the window
For tellin me its hot when its not and you got what you got
From them rocks on the block, you can stop tellin Dre you got shot
With a Glock that don't phase me
I'm crazy why the fuck you think I'm rhyming with Shady ?
I don't care if the radio don't play me
I say what I say when I feel like I'm feelin today
And get hard when these bitches see my car in the streets
I can't even take my son to cop them G-Unit sneaks
So I'm gone bitch
So they callin us
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
We ain't goin no where so fuck you

Left undone, tied to imagination, letting go,

My lucky star...

Cause time is moving quickly now, still out of reach,
Giving in I start to fall to pieces, letting go,
It seems so hard, lighting up and burning out,
My lucky star...My lucky star...
My lucky star (keeps on burning out)

And when, time tells me that we're moving on,
Soon we'll fall to pieces, soon we'll fall to pieces,

Staring at a family flawless
But it ain't a pretty picture tonight

Puts her hands over her ears

No sting, no hurt no one, just a bang bang
Rolling off your tongue (I wish words were like little toy guns)

No kick from the trigger when you pull it, no pain, no damage done

And just a bang bang rolling off your tongue

Wish there was a white flag waving
Or that they were both just faking
And it was just a game they were playing
Like shoot'em up cowboys
Leave the plastic pistols in the front yard
Throw away the score card
And just turn off all the noise.

Of a deserted ally, nor the clamor of a crowded street. F.E.A.R. can not be
Vanquished, we can not be destroyed. F.E.A.R. will rise up again and
Control the masses, take back the power and crush the insurgent hoard. As
War fades in to the distant memories of enlightened pigs and open wounds,
Rebels will begin to perish - one by one, it should. Feel the fear of dying
Young, not ignore the chance to scream. Lie awake at night in terror,
Admitting F.E.A.R. will return to glory and the story of Rebels who set out
To conquer will finish.

351411	Hip-Hop	"[Chorus]
Emotions in this game run deep
So before these haters kill me in my sleep
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure
Reppin' 'til my last second through
Done a lot of shit they'll never get to do
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure
Honored to be somebody they mention
But before these niggas stop payin' attention
I'll just say it's been a pleasure
You'll never be somebody they need
Tomorrow ain't guaranteed
So tonight we gon' do it like this
Oh, for the H-Town
Tonight I'm gon' make some money go
For the H-Town
Ladies and gentlemen,
You're now listenin' to the Dirty South trillionaire ('naire)
Keepin' it trill in there, been here and he's still in there (there)
Pay attention, it's the beginnin' of a new era (era)
Get a little closer you can see the view clearer (view clearer)
It's like Lasik but are basic
Ebonics if you're hooked on chronic and you can taste it
Trace it, recognize the real when ya face it
Ball up in the club gettin white boy wasted
One shot of Patron, then another one to chase it
Put me to the test, I won't pass it I'll ace it
Been so many places, up and down the interstate
Cities that I've never been, wonderin' if they fin' to hate
Step up in the spot, let 'em look me in the grill (grill)
So they can see it for they self that I keep it trill (I keep it trill)
I paid the cost to be the boss and left a tip
So it's all good (good) don't even trip
Believe me it's been a pleasure
[Chorus]
Man I've been all over the world
Tryin' to tell 'em 'bout the trill and what we been through (through)
What we already done and what we fin' do (do)
What we got into, what we gettin' into (to)
When ties 'bout to cut it closer than a Ginsu ('su)
Roll through Atlanta, Birmingham, Alabama ('bama)
Jacksonville to Jackson, Mississippi spittin' grammar (spittin' grammar)
From Shreveport ('port) down to New Orleans ('leans)
And all points in between just to get the cream (cream)
Me and my ""II Trill"" team on the road flippin' (flippin')
Eight hours straight, no stops, no trippin' (trippin')
Had to keep them heaters on 'em so it's no slippin' (slippin')
Promote a play with show money, we were slow grippin' (slow grippin')
Sometimes we rock the stage and put it down (down)
Other times we had to fight and shoot it out of town (town)
But we always made it home okay
And we still on the road to this day
I gotta say it's been a pleasure
[Chorus]
They say that you never really know
What you got 'til it's gone and can't touch it (touch it)
If it look too good to be true, you can't trust it (trust it)
If you never had it (had it) then you can never miss it (miss it)
But looks can be deceivin', so don't you get it twisted (twisted)
Walked a lot of miles in these old school J's (J's)
Thought of many ways, lookin' at back in the days (days)
Like how to climb from in between a rock, and a hard place
How to keep your cool when you're dealin' with a hard case (with a hard case)
And how to duck, when the judge throw the book at you (the book at you)
And it's a two-sided mirror that you're lookin' through (you're lookin' through)
The phone receiver's in your hand starin at your child (child)
And your heart skips a beat every time they smile (smile)
See that's how real life is and how it can be (can be)
And how it's deeper then just comin' down candy (candy)
So I'm just tryin' to play the cards that they hand me
For those that overstood me, understand me
It's been a pleasure
[Chorus]
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure
I'll just say it's been a pleasure"

To this life I've made, but don't understand

In this whirlwind world that will never last
This love you're giving me
It's not just make believe
Help me just to hold one
You open the sky, and open my eyes
And all my fears are scattered away
So I walk in grace, because I've seen your face
You are all that matters to me
So I'm gonna live, I'm gonna love
I'm not afraid because your grace will always be enough

Curse this morning sun, drags me into one more day
Of reaping what I've sown, living with my shame
Welcome to my world, and the life that I have made
One day you're a prince, and the next day you're a slave

And realized how far away I am from where You are

Try to serve Ivan
No surviving
You're a land rover, I'm a land expander
Here to hand you your first loss, Alexander
I'll school you like Aristotle
Smack you harder than you hit that bottle
You're nothing but an overrated lush, I'll crush ya
I'm the first Tsar of all of Russia
You're an asshole with an anastole
I'm heaven sent, divine and holy
So don't even try to approach the God
Or you'll get a huge sack like Novgorod
Hey fella, swell diss
But now you got the Panhellenist from Pella hella pissed
Stepping up's foolish as well as useless
Little Vasilyevich, let me spell out the list
I brought foes to their knees in Phoenicia
Breezed through Gaza to Giza
Had the Balkans, Persia, Syria, Iraq and Pakistan
In my expansion pack
While you died in the middle of a game of chess
You got vodka bars, flavorless
And what I'm about to spit will be the craziest
So go fix me a drink so I can stay refreshed
Kudos! Greek for the glory I got
From winning every single war that I fought
So this will be straight forward, I'll take up this sword that I brought
And slice you in half like the Gordian knot
And I'll soar to the top like the eagle whose feather I would sport in the helmet that I wore
As I swatted my many enemies, shattered 'em like a porcelain pot
And they'd be praying for the torture to stop
But I would leave 'em contorted and they'd be screaming and roaring
Until their vocal chords were torn up and shot
And I would holler Bucephalus!
Hop on my horsey and trot
I win Ivan, I vanquish
I'm an immortal, you're not
Enough!
I don't stand a chance against your skills

What's wrong?
I feel a bit queasy
Ha! You've been poisoned!
Oh, the pain is unbearable!
My stomach's riddled with holes!
Ugh, I'm terrible
There's no great who could defeat this Russian
Psst, what about a flute busting Prussian?
(Old Fritz, old fritz!
Old Fritz, old fritz!
Old Fritz, old fritz!
Old Fritz, old fritz!)
I'm Frederick the Great, out the gate first servant of state
Oblique attack tactics ain't exactly straight
I've got creative talents and battle malice
Hard as steel on the field, genteel in the palace
Russia's fucked up but no wonder why
With your tundras and taigas and bears, oh my!
I would pay a guy to tear out my eyes
If I had to look at your troll face every night
Now bring me my chair
I'm weary from tearing you a new derriÃ¨re from here to Red square
Fought a Seven Years' War, I ain't scared of a Tsar
Cause beating you only took me twelve bars
Oh, what a humiliating defeat!
I know when I am beat
So of course, take a seat
'd keep ripping you to shreds
But I'll take a break instead
And just rest my little head
Why don't you drop dead, Fred?!
Hmm, my expectations were a lot higher
But at least I saved the rubles on the garrote wire
It's another great day and another great victory
Cause no great can beat me
What about me?
Pompey! Yeah!
Macedonians, Prussians and Romans
Those aren't worthy opponents
It takes a Russian to take down a Russian
I'm Cath, I'm a cat, you're a rodent
How are you the head of our state
When the state of your head was such a crazy one?
Such sick shit going through your brain
That you stuck a spike through your own son (Oooh)
You're unbalanced like I unbalanced the European powers with the wars I waged
I brought the Russian empire straight out of the olden days and right into the golden age
I'm the boss bitch that you just can't meddle with
This whole battle's like Alaska cause I settled it
Hmmm, what a beautiful Queen to beat me in a battle
Accept this gift, Your Highness: I hear you enjoy the saddle
That horse story is a pile of shit
Though I do keep 'em chomping at the bit
But you're never gonna get it, nyet
Couldn't spin in my chamber if this were Russian roulette
I'm picking up where Peter the Great left off
Bringing sexy back to House Romanov
So don't call me Queen, I'm far more great
Empress to Tsar 8, bitch

And I'm sorry, if my momentary lapse just caused you one more thing
And knowing what I've done can tug a fraying tear
Like thread slipping through my fingers and that's not much to show for pain
Endured
But in the end you'll learn its worth
Alone by yourself only hurts if you need someone
To need truly need anothers touch can lead you into hell

Crawling in darkness, only a glimmer of hope as she yelled these words.
I'll face my pain
On my own - standing strong
Prove for myself."

Love snuck up on us love snuck up on us
Caught me by surprise like it does love snuck up on us
I didn't even want to run except into your arms eternally

Well, they confuse me

Pale in the sunshine

In the cool sheets past bed time

243500	Rock	"Somewhere in these private minds,
The last one comes just in time to clear out
The chambers and sew up the lips,
'Cause that's the price to pay for hoping every slips not a slide.
In other words not to get it wrong,
It's pointless to walk when it's past time to run.
Secured under the weight of watchful eyes,
Lulled to sleep under clear expansive skies.
Somewhere in these prying hearts
Conflicting histories tear us apart
And we hope we don't get what we deserve,
Hide behind the targets in front of all the people we serve."
227464	Rock	"14 today and you went dancing
Music mixed with laughter
And boys can be so insecure
They made you drink a bit too much
Everything's a blur of feel and touch
Did he really like you
How can you be sure enough
23 today and all your friends are getting married
You say they're so scared of being alone
So self righteously you march though teachers college
Still so much in life you gotta get to know
Seems like everybody's so content to move so slow
And when you think you've got your life so well controlled
It slips away
And the years like raindrops falling from your life are
Washed away
You're so brilliant, you're so gifted, so sensitive, so strong
As you hide behind your barricade of words
But no one got close enough to you to have ever heard
I met you at a party you were drunk and full of world advice
And I was getting nervous
You said you had a child who was a genius and you smiled
As the living room transformed into your circus
Someone whispered you were 39 today a face so you
Eyes so old
You collapsed into the corner
Like somebody of raw nerves you near seduced me
With your verbs
As I reached out for you
You said over and over"

Hablar de amor sin que se rÃ­an de ti
SÃ© que en el rincÃ³n de una pared
Hay mÃ¡s de un lugar para pensar
SÃ© que en la pared de algÃºn lugar
Alguien dibujÃ³ su nombre por amor
Yo no sÃ© quiÃ©n fue, cualquiera pudo ser
Nadie, nadie, nadie debe esconder
El nombre que dejÃ³ escrito en la pared
Nunca, nunca, nunca niegues que una vez
Pintaste en un papel su cara sin saber
Que ella dibujaba grandes corazones
En una pared, en algÃºn rincÃ³n
Que ella no pensaba mÃ¡s que en ser amada
Por ilusiÃ³n escrita en un papel
SÃ© que desde ayer me he vuelto a creer
Que en un papel, que en un rincÃ³n o una pared
Puedo encontrar el corazÃ³n de una mujer
Que me busca, me desea, que se muere, por querer
QuÃ© importan los necios que no sienten
QuÃ© importa, quÃ© cuenta la risa de esa gente
Si yo te quiero, si en un dibujo yo
SÃ© quiÃ©n eres
Nadie, nadie, nadie debe esconder

Nunca, nunca, nunca niegues que una vez

Che nonostante il mal di testa stavo lÃ¬
Maledetta la tempesta e maledetta me
Svegliata di notte,
Nel buio dell'attesa
Le mie speranze navigavano la via
Sulle note di quella canzone
Scritta da noi due,
Rimirando all'alba un'emozione
Che non perderÃ² mai piÃ¹
Confondo bene e male, mai piÃ¹
Confondo terra e mare
Salutando I gesti di un passato
Negato all'allegria
Sotto l'ombra riparata di una barca
A dirsi addio
Mi culla ciÃ² che poi sarÃ 
Bagnato di malinconia
Bellezza, incanto e nostalgia
Mi perdo nell'ostilitÃ 
Che non mi ha fatto stare lÃ¬
E mi ha costretta a dire addio
E mi ha costretta a dire addio
Io chiudevo le porte,
Paure e fremito
Cantavo piÃ¹ forte
Per fermarti e averti qui
Sulle note della tua canzone
Dedicata a me
Che suona nel tuo cuore
Nella culla del passato
E ci scoprimmo a quel bagliore
ChissÃ  se rivedrÃ² mai piÃ¹
Se solo avessi avuto piÃ¹ carattere e follia
La tua voce ora sarebbe ancora mia
Mi culla ciÃ² che poi sarÃ 
Bagnato di malinconia
Bellezza, incanto e nostalgia
Mi perdo nell'ostilitÃ 
Che non mi ha fatto stare lÃ¬
E mi ha costretta a dire addio
E mi ha costretta a dire addio
E ricordi fari e fuoco
E sabbia che calpesterai
Dimmi una bugia perÃ² non dirmi che ti volterai
Ti racconto storie di passioni e giochi persi ormai
Sappi amore mio che se potessi non ti lascerei
Mi culla ciÃ² che poi sarÃ 
Bagnato di malinconia
Bellezza, incanto e nostalgia
Mi perdo nell'ostilitÃ

330738	Metal	"Late night comes are you home?
No you're not
You're out with urge to satisfy yourself it's your vicious plot
Looking back I realize that it's my fault
I'm not around so your love comes to a halt
You have no remorse in you
It's the only thing you know
You destroy me every time you little cunt
I never wanted this
Gave myself to you to get paid back with lies
Every time I trust you I lose in the end
I feel disgust in myself
I love how you can call me and pretend you're innocent
While I'm out here trying to better myself
You're a pig when it comes to my emotions
You drown me in your wake because you have no devotion
You have no remorse in you
It's the only thing you know
You destroy me every time you little cunt
I never wanted this
Gave myself to you to get paid back with lies
Every time I trust you I lose in the end"
202038	Rock	"When she said, ""Don't waste your words, they're just lies""
I cried she was deaf
And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes
And saying ""What else you got left?""
It was then that I got up to leave
But she said, ""Don't forget
Everybody must give something back
For something they get""
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum
I asked her how come
And she buttoned her boot, and straightened her suit
And she said, ""Don't be cute""
So I forced my hands in my pockets
And felt with my thumbs
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt
Where everyone walked
But, when finding out I'd forgotten my shirt
I went back and knocked
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it
And I tried to make sense
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair
That leaned up against
Her Jamaican rum, and when she did come
I asked her for some
She said, ""No, dear"", I said, ""Your words are not clear
You'd better spit out your gum""
She screamed till her face got so red
Then she fell on the floor
I covered her up and then went and looked through her drawer
And, when I was through, I filled up my shoe
And brought it to you
And you, you took me in, you loved me then
You didn't waste time
And I, I never took much, I never asked for your crutch
Now don't ask for mine"

This room's not big enough for two.
He swears she'd work his words out, If she ever knew.
How do I find her, Bearing my heart in hand.
Last winter, Anne Arbour Was all I had.
I still wear your heart around my throat
I still wear your heart around my throat
With barely the air not to choke.
Never, not ever again.
I finally replaced every promise you've taken away.
Now that it's over, I'm older and colder this way.

I'm not answering questions for you that are not clear
What up to State Prop the crew, were they not there?
The moment that they heard it the verdict
When it was declared, ya boy had to sit a year
Did they really disappear, did Jay really not visit there?
Dame and Bean's are they tight as it seems
Or is it all fabricated from that same fabric
That ripped the Roc marriage straight from the scenes
Things ain't what it seems but in time do tell the truth shall prevail
Until then you dudes bite y'all nails in anticipation
Before I know you hate it
Why I got you waiting, I too am waiting
Gotta see a couple faces when I make them face it

Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say, ""What did you do with him today?""

Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear me down like Roger Moore
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good
Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy
He's in the place, but I can't get joy
Thinking of you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes
Run out to meet your chips and pitter
You say when we're married 'cause you're not bitter
There'll be none of him no more
I cried for you on the kitchen floor
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good
Ayo, I knew you was trouble when I first laid eyes on you
Temperature's so hot, the heat just rise with you
Let me ride with you, talk about your mistakes
You cheated yourself but these are the breaks
And it never be the same again, cause of old boy
But oh boy, together we make so much joy
In the sands and oh, what a wet, wee-wee
But you played me, so I had to roll up my sleeves and
Hunt you down, holding the next man's stacks
Now you sorry, tryin' bring that old thing back and
Act like we can rekindle that flame
It's a shame, how you can't get me off the brain
He that lame, you love how I bring the pain
Got the rug burns stinging and you saying my name
Say my name, that's right, I'm high post
Get the champagne, love, word up, we gon' toast
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
Yet you know that I'm no good"

Rain on the window, wind in the trees
It's my time to write, it's your time to call
There's something about distance that gets to us all
Dark clouds above me, little people below
All walk with a purpose with someplace to go
It's my place to paint my own selfish scene
On this cold lonely canvas, it's just the weather and me
And latitude
Fold back the morning and bring on the night
There's an alien moon
That hangs between darkness and light
Latitude between me and you
You're a straight line of distance
A cold strech of black across blue
Latitude
Cracks in the sidewalks, dogs on the run
An old poster reading ""Give us your sons""
Window frames capture moments in time
But latitude captures the heart and the mind"

What time will allow us

I know you don't like hearing this
But I feel like we're making a huge mistake
Well. Maybe it's too late, you know
Maybe I should just let you go..listen,
[Verse 1:]
Boy meets girl, girl likes boy
It was your typical story, but I
Was hard to get, I made you wait
And you kept your eye on the prize
And it paid off 'cause we found love
And everything fit like a glove
Perfector so it seemed to be to me
Tell me is this worth it
Girl, nobody is perfect
So what, so what am I supposed to do when
[Chorus:]
Every time I try to walk away
There's always something that reminds me I should stay, yeah
Girl I know I should be strong
But girl it feels so wrong, holding on
It's so much easier said than done
[Verse 2:]
We spent some time when you were mine
Tell me where it all went
You promised me, you'd never leave
Do you break all your promises?
Just like you broke my heart so easily
Saying you love me was just a tease to me
I wanted the real thing but you lost the feeling for me
And now, is this worth it
When we're both hurting
I know you can't hide it from yourself
[Chorus:]
And now every time you try to walk away (now every time you try)
There's always something that reminds you of my face (oh baby yeah)
You know you should be strong (you can be strong)
But you feel so wrong, moving on without me, on without me
Is easier said than done
[Bridge:]
I know we've had our ups and downs
You need some time alone
Maybe it's best we go our own ways
But it's so hard

And now every time I try to walk away (every time I try to walk away)
There's something that reminds me I should stay (oh yeah)

Moving on without you, on without you
Oh it's easier said than done"

Walking o'er the city pride
Streets are paved with heaven's pennies
Gutters full of suicides
Teddy steadily fell from grace
Somewhere near Arcadia
Once she overheard a voice
That she didn't hear on the radio
Velvet gloves and country clubs
Were never going to hold her
Ringing the necks of silly
Southern belles
Who wanted to scold her
[Chorus]
Don't bring me down
I'm trouble bound
Blue song
Red Alert
Who made Stella Hurt?
Teddy soon dropped out of sight
Turned up in another town
Changed her name for the spotlight
Singing like a blue bird in a sequin gown
She finally fell and married well
But I knew it wouldn't last
Reversing back into the limelight
No one ever saw her even half-plastered
[Chorus]
Then she saw those soldier boys
Throw their bonnets in the air
Self-made men would pledge their fortunes
And dream of her
And dream of her...
Generals in the commissary opened up a case of wine
Checked the perfume of the cork
Said ""Made in 1929""...
They used her up, to raise morale for money
And Old Glory
Her voice was shot beyond repair
But this is not the last act of this story
The night is black as cracked shellac
Abandoned in an attic
Stella is silent as the grave
Until the needle drags her through the static

Invoke them with a chant,
Let gruesome ghouls attack,
From beneath the hellish flame

Where you can't tell the night from the sunrise
And not all the King's horses and all the King's men
Have prevented the fall of the unwise
For they think it will make their lives easier
And God knows up till now it's been hard

I feel you in the air, yeah
I'm not afraid
I know what you're thinking
I can hear you everywhere
Some people say it'll never happen
We're just wasting time
But good things come when you least expect them
So I don't really mind
We'll be together
Come whatever
I'm not just staring at the stars
Just remember
That no one else can tell us who we are
We'll be together
So don't ever stop listening to your heart
'Cause I can't turn mine off
I can't pretend
This is a rehearsal for the real thing
Because it's not, and
I know we're young
But I can't help feeling what I'm feeling
And I won't stop
Some things are meant to be, and they'll be there
When the time is right
Even though I know that I swear
I wish it was tonight
We'll be together
Come whatever
I'm not just staring at the stars
Just remember
That no one else can tell us who we are
We'll be together
So don't ever stop listening to your heart
'Cause I can't turn mine off
I like what's happening to me
Nothing else to say
Somebody finally got to me
Carried me away
We'll be together
Come whatever
I'm not just staring at the stars
Just remember
That no one else can tell us who we are
We'll be together
So don't ever stop listening to your heart

CHORUS 1:
So you sailed away
Into a grey sky morning
Now I'm here to stay
Love can be so boring
Nothing's quite the same now
I just say your name now
CHORUS 2:
But it's not so bad
You're only the best I've ever had
You don't want me back
You're just the best I've ever had
So you stole my world
Now I'm just a phony
Remembering the girl
Leaves me down and lonely
Send it in a letter
Make yourself feel better
Repeat CHORUS 2
And it may take some time to
Patch me up inside
But I can't take it so I
Run away and hide
And I may find in time that
You were always right
You're always right
Repeat CHORUS 1
What was it you wanted
Could it be I'm haunted
But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
I don't want you back
You're just the best I ever had
The best I ever had"

It's the final chapter, it's the final chapter (Rapid, Rapid Ric)
I'm the greedy genius (hold, hold up)

You in the presence of the finest (Chamillitary mayne)

It's the final chapter
[Verse - Chamillionaire]
This is part two, caught you, sittin in the dark you
Know that I'm a nightmare, it ain't really no need to argue
Sharpshoot, sharp pum (*gunshot*), bullets that will carve you
Keep on mean muggin man, I hope your vest is hard too
This will be a message to all those who say they Texas made
I confess I got the best of all mixtapes that Texas made
Really ain't nothin left to say, I don't got to step to A
There will only be a 100 copies, all the rest is fake
For many years they complained when I dropped 'em late
So I had a attitude, I purposely would switch the date
Some will hate, I know I'm great, some will go eBay the tape
I gave you a 100 dollar bill that you couldn't even break
They tryin to drop me late, like wait until December
But I can't wait for Universal to get their ish together
It's like whatever, you never should eat with the Devil
But when I go I'll be the greatest Houston hustler ever, ever
[Outro - Chamillionaire - talking]
Yeah, she what I had to realize is
I'm not very good at waitin for people to make moves
I'm from Texas
Home of the players that know how to break the rules and make the rules
You know what I'm sayin?
We've been doin that before anybody came in the game
Before the fame, before all that
So why don't we go back to what we used to do, huh?

Every feature needs to be loved from the start
Defend her and shell surrender
Offend her and she will harden her heart
A delicate creature is something she aint, but atake it from me thats a woman
That isnt an angel, that isnt saint, but atake it from me thats woman
She knows how to please and she knows how to play, take it from me thats a woman
Forget to honor love and obey shell take you and break you and throw you away,
Thats a woman, Thats a woman.
She knows every move and knows every trick, take it from me thats a woman
How to kill with a word and cut to the quake(?) take it from me, thats a woman
How to look through you as if youre not there, take it form me thats a woman
How to say no with a flick of her hair, shell turn you and burn you and not even care, Thats a woman, thats a woman
Faithful and true, thats a woman, trusting in you, thats a woman
Gentle and constantly caring, strong as the love she is sharing
When you look in the eyes of a woman (look in here eyes, youll see nothing but lies, thats a woman)
And through the disguise of a woman (every one is the same, shes just playing a game, shes a woman)
Youll see in all there, theres romance in the air
Nothing else can compare, thats a woman.
Woman, so soft and beguiling,
See her smiling, and feel your heart all aglow
Enfold her, lay her head on your shoulder
And hold her till you just cant let her go.
Treat her as if you just dont give a damn, thats how to handle a woman
Be more of a stallion, less of a lamb, thats how to handle a woman
Keep her hanging around till shes ready to burst, thats how to handle a woman
Dont try to be bad, be the worst, do unto others but just do it first
To a woman, to a woman
Be wise, be wary and be on your guard, thats how to handle a woman
If you feel that youre falling, youd better be hard, cause thats how to handle a woman
Dont let her get closer, and dont let her in, thats how to handle a woman
Cuz if you allow her get under your skin, my friend thats the end, cause you aint gonna win
With a woman, with a woman
Look at her body and look at her move, now thats what I call a woman
Im thinking now Ive got something to prove, cause thats what I call a woman
All my moves are stalling here, I cant get through to this woman
The pipes, the pipes are calling here, I think I could be falling here for this woman
What a woman
Faithful and true, thats a woman (She couldnt be true, shes just playing with you, what a woman)
Trusting in you, thats a woman (Trusting in who, you just havent a clue, what a woman
Gentle and constantly caring (Just let it be this ones for me, what a woman)
Strong as the love she is sharing
When you look in the eyes of a woman
And through the disguise of a woman
Youll see it(?) all there, theres romance in the air
Nothing else can compare, thats a wo-
Who would have thought Id ever get caught
What a woman!"

In all the years we had
As part of a family tree
We knew the good and bad
I can see it in you, you can see it in me.
I know it's left its mark on you
I see the same things in myself
You know there's nothin' we can't do
We've been a long time waitin', but some things never die.
It's time to leave all that behind
It's time to lay that ghost to rest
We can't deny the ties that bind
Tonight we're gonna sing out, tonight our light will shine.

Nigga whatever you niggas want, we bringin' it!
Thug Luv, nigga. What time is it?
Yo, I don't give a fuck where you lay at
Nigga, it's time to slay these bitch-made niggas!
They ain't even knowing what type of niggas we is
Where my thugs at? Bone thugs-n-harmony
I know you niggas been waiting for this for a long time
Well, here it is, nigga. Here it is. What you gonna do with it?
Well, it must be close to the Armageddon, Lord
Know that I won't fly by that lesson
You taught me to pull out my Wesson you brought me
And I'm not stressing it softly
Get 'em up off me, cause all we
Wanted was harmony, been bombing em
Yell up out of my ghetto, I won't settle, get on my level
They can't stop me and pop me
Nigga, they got me? Fuck no
Little Pac gets schizophrenic, and manage to damage all y'all
I'll talk about 'em, and you don't really want it
'Cause they're cornered, and I'm want 'em to not jump
I'd rather say that we came to shut 'em all down
So quick to test, bullet, yes, declare war
Roll, I'll flow when I get the gun for the murder
Mo' horror! Why? They did it all, pause for the cause
And I finna to pull a 9 or pistol, and lit a nigga with mine
Fuck them niggas, it's on
All y'all fall! Bizzy getting bitches to test me
Bless the floor, and any attempt to arrest me, stress me
Lord, looking at death with the last of my breath
Follow, follow, my kids!
No, don't sin in my steps!
Yet the weapon is kept with the best of my secrets
Deep in the reach, I'm alone. Nigga believe
That I can see it, if needed, and if you really with me
And well then let it be, get the greens and we running up over Cleveland
Ha, ha! What's poppin', nigga?
Put your muthafucking hands on your strap, nigga
Thug Luv, nigga. Yeah, we can do this like gangstas and slug it out
Or do this like punks and punk it out
Pull your strap on me, nigga, you better kill me!
Thug life, baby. Thug Luv
I'll probably be punished for hard living, blind to the facts:
Thugs is convicts in God's prison, hands on the strap
Praying so Father please forgive me! Police be rushing when they see me
I flaunt it: America's Most Wanted, live on T.V
Life: pleasure and pain, stuck in this game, holler my name!
We all gon' die, we bleed through similar veins
Please explain to me, now. Don't panic when my guns burst
Heard the last jam, nigga? This one's worse!
My nigga Bone held the chrome 'til I came home
Thug Luv players tell these bitch niggas ""bring it on""
I caught a plane out to Cleveland late last evening
To help my niggas clean up some niggas no longer breathin'
Now, who do you believe in? Hit the weed and breathe
It's a cold-ass world; niggas kill you in your sleep
Watch me until they stop me, bury, murder me or drop me
I got Thug Luv for my nationwide posse. Feel me!
Little thug from the Land, nigga, never ran
Muthafuckas out to get me. They don't understand
It's the #1 nigga out with a nation of niggas
Down to put it some work and do some dirt
Fuckin' around with the band Bone Thugs-n-Harmony
Follow down the road, we stroll to meet karma
Everything I do, it seem to cause drama
Ready for the war like a knight in my armor, bomb ya!
So quick to test us, nigga wanna crash me, eat dust
For the love of the lust, niggas busting on us
Hit 'em up with the buck, 12-gauge eruptions!
It's the Art of War, putting niggas on the floor
When I'm coming through the door, bringing nothing but terror
Causing much pain to the nigga that dared us
Tried to put a twist in this thugsta era. Paired up
With a nigga like Pac, and a nigga like me: gotta stay high
Thug luv 'til I die, keep my prayer to the sky
But I'm still in the hood, smoke and fry
So I beg the Lord save us all: escapers of misery
Bless my niggas in penitentiaries, soldiers of the century, yeah
Here to get it, told my niggas they need get the hell
Down with the dirt, and we don't fuck around
Buck a couple a rounds, and if your passing through
Then hit the ground and don't get caught up in the crossfire, nigga
Artillery thick, and you don't wanna get to fucking with this
I'm straight devil, not a punk and pretend
I reload, buck a little mo'
Flee the scene 'fore the po-po even know
""So, who ya looking for?"" They don't know!
A mothafucka with a leatherface
Hey, man, she said I ran this way, said I ran that a way
Ya hoes'll never know because I got away

'Cause we out riding, looking for you
Better run for cover, nigga, duck!

37059	Country	"If I could find the heart to love again
Wouldn't make the same mistakes I did back then
I wouldn't write a day
Or let a moment slip away
To tell her just how much she means to me
If I could find the one I've waited for
Wouldn't take her love for granted like before
I'd try to recognize
The ""want to"" in her eyes
And her hopes and dreams I'd hold so carefully
I wouldn't let it fall apart
If I Could find the heart to love again
If I could find the heart to love again
I really wouldn't know where to begin
Time is passin' by
Still I'm to afraid to try
If only I could trust like I did then
I would make a brand new start
If I could find the heart to love again
Cause what I'm searchin' for
Is that special kind of love they're just not makin' anymore
That lasts through all the years
The kind of love that lives beyond the laughter and the tears
So I'll just keep on lookin' round the bend
And someday soon I'll reach my journey's end
Together we will grow
With a love we've come to know
And promises we'll keep eternally
I wouldn't let it fall apart
I would make a brand new start
If I could find the heart to love again
If I could find the heart to love again"

Try to take it all
That's what you were taught
When you were small
Something for nothing
Just ain't the way
Everything you got
Had a price to pay
Who can you believe
When you turn your back
Who can you believe
When you're being told
Hard lies hard lies
They seem to surround our lives
Hard lies hard lies
Like the chill of a cold, dark night
People look at you
Right in the eyes
Calling you 'friend'
While they tell you lies
Taking from you
All that they can
Making you feel
Like a lesser man
Who can you believe
When you turn your back
Who can you believe
When you're being told
Hard lies hard lies
They seem to surround our lives
Hard lies hard lies

Biscuits light as feather pillows
At Mama's house
Sunday morning kids a squirming
Thank the preacher for the sermon
As you're walking out
Sweet old fashion goodness
Old man comes out and pumps your gas
Tells a joke while he cleans your glass
And says that you friend
Grab a cup of sugar from your neighbor
Honor roll made the morning paper
Cut it out again
Sweet old fashion goodness
[Chorus]
We don't need no bureaucrats
No scientists or diplomats
To help us figure out what this world needs
Just sweet old fashion goodness
He says have you met my young bride
We got married back in '49
She ain't changed at all
There's a nervous boy on the front porch waiting
While the daddy of the girl hes been dating
Lays down the law
Sweet old fashion goodness

Your vain attempts to blank it out
Troubled, in a state of doubt

Demons stalk your hide
No chance for you to get away
Without their affliction
Everything you ever wanted
They turn into hideous shards...
They are haunting your thoughts now
They are probing your soul
Examine with indifferent eyes
How you are WRITHING in shame

(But) This is not my cross
For it...
Keeps me away, keeps me away...

O que miles de ninos se alimentan solo con arroz
Why cuando miras al de al lado
Why lo vez tan necesitado
Que regalo tan preciado la fortuna nos ha dado

Para que sentirnos ciertos si la vida nos da igual?
O para que creernos todo lo que demos si al final
No sabemos ni siquiera si es fantasia o realidad
O realidad, o realidad

Why no saben todavia por donde van a empezar
Why si todos individuos fueramos de un color distinto
Seguro seguiria habiendo problemas de igualdad racial

Olvidamos las pequenas alegrias por lograr la gran felicidad
Son detalles de la vida

Instead I was blind
Ignoring what people would say
When will I ever learn
Can't blame it all on one word
Some words can seem more brutal than kind

Feeling scared, she's prepared
To give up everything
She can't stand to feel like half of her is fading
He will choose the only way
To rid her of her pain
Take her soul now; the decision has been made
Living in a world without love (burning into my soul)
Is living in a worthless world
So I will call on you
Remember me: I gave you life
You would not take it
Your suffering was all in vain
It's almost over
Remember me; you were so young
How could I tell you?
Remember me: I am the one
Who saved your life that night
I was the one who would not
Abandon you
Even in death I was the one who would not leave you
I used my freedom to protect you
And all the while direct you
Do you remember me this time?
Even in death I gave you life
I gave you life
I wanted to deserve a place...
A place beside you
This time when I reach out my hand
It reached all the way to heaven
Remember me: I gave you life
You would not take it
Your suffering was all in vain
It's almost over now
Goodbye
It's almost over now
Goodbye
It's time I release you from this life
Don't turn your back on Paradise"
294908	Metal	"Karges, dunkles Land.
Gänzlich still, weit, unbekannt.
Sollst so manch Legende schüren,
doch heut mir nur die Kutsche führen.
Durch wilde, kahle Klüfte -
hinein ins Ödeland. (still, weit, unbekannt)
Dort herrschen eisge Lüfte,
wie nie zuvor gekannt. (tief drinn im Ödeland)
Wohin ich blick - nur Eis und Schnee...
gespenstge Kiefer, dunkler See...
schauderhaftes schließt mich ein -
kein Weg, kein Steg, kein Lampenschein!
Der Pferde Kräfte schwinden
in einer Nebelwand,
gepeitscht von Geisterwinden,
der Schlaf mich übermannt -
tief drin im Ödeland."

And afterwards the meat
With spangles on my long-tailed suits
And songs to haunt the one that's saved
Just call me Desdinova

The lucky one
When destiny assigns wisdom
Known to me
The starry wisdom
I am (I am)
The one you warned me of
I am (I am)
The one who'd never, never lie
The writing in the notebook
Notation from the stars
Songs by Desdinova
And frost warnings from the women's farm
Whose agents could not ever see
His hilly eyes and two green rings
Obscured sight and fancy dreams
Holy mass, those thirteen fancy dreams
I am (Iam)
The one you warned me of
I am (I am)
The one who'd never, never lie
Eyes like bottles and hands in my hair
Bottles of blackness, the blacker to spare
I'll sit myself behind that clock
And play tunes on it's belfry
Five fingers have I to play them like ten
Ten fingers have I to play them again
In decimal chains called mimicry
Whose notes will never, never fly
Until they quit those timely tunes
And enter that system from outside
I am (I am)
The one you warned me of
I am (I am)
The one who'd never, never lie

Don't trust your instincts

Reminds me of a time so long ago.
And through each drop of rain I see,
Within my heart you'll always be.

They tell me nothing ever stays the same.
And as the leaves all turn to brown,
I watch them floating to the ground.
I pray you will remember me with love.
As I look back on the springtime,
There is one day I recall.
Blankets of gold in the fields of love.
Remember, remember.
The coldest days of winter draw so close now.
You'll light the fire to keep away the chills.
And in the embers you might see,
A flame that burns for you and me.

Such a dirty game

You know my image as a pimp, it can be kind of hard to ignore
Because of my image, I might call you a whore
You know my image as a pimp, it can be hard to accept
You gotta be open for some disrespect
Word around town is I pop these P's
Word around town is I hold these G's
Word around town is I blow these trees
Word around town is Baby Beesh

Gettin' all these keys at playa prices
Top notch ho by da name of Icess
Soak it up qick 'cause da game is priceless
Money and mackin' is nothin' nice (bitch)
I'm out in Ohio man I missed my trial
Feds after me 'cause I serve this D
Got blessed as Golden child
[Chorus]
I dominate the ladies, insult the ladies
Some think that Oral Bee is badgering the ladies
I massage some ladies.but keep it on the hush
I'm a pimp, shit, I'm not supposed to have no crush
Met this lady, she was off the hook
A playa got hard off her sexy look
To my homies I said that she was crazy horny
And, like most bitches she was dumb and corny
Well, the truth is that this girl was mad intelligent
I wanted to follow her ass everywhere it went
Yes Suh! This mama turned me on
But then she met some slick-talkin' playa and was gone
He was a nasty playa who called her a queen
Now, I can't do that, I am a pimp-machine
Sometimes I wish that pretty bitch still was mine
But, I got the image of a pimp, and I stay true to it all the time
[Chorus]
Image of a pimp is what I got
Take a look at me girl I live it hard
I ain't chose to rhyme my game is cold
Million dollar mouth piece have you bringin doe
Back to the daddy in a candy caddy
Wit a half bag of Afghanastani
'cause me and Beesh see we blowin' big
Can't help us now 'cause we on it
Ohh look we slammin' da bom on it
Don't act like yo ass ain't noticed it
I'm rollin' wit a bunch of hoggs
Y'all ready know they like to ball
I get paid fo sex give me the money on a daily basis
Have yo ass on the track till 8 in da morning

Spend a little of your time with me
What is it that holds you here to me?
You must be moved by something that you see
Strains of magic in the moonlight hours
Render useless all your Earthly powers
Souvenirs of childhood haunt your face
It must be that they've fallen from your grace
And the rage burns inside
Like a cage that's open wide
Empty now, but once it held
The boundaries of your mind
Privacy and loneliness
They overlap sometimes, sometimes
Subtleties betray you everywhere
That's a secret you forgot to share
Like how auburn still brings out your guilty streak
And seemingly it adds to your mystique
Moody silhouettes, you soon replace
With swarms of passersby that flood your space
Your superficial scars, you can conceal
There are others left with wounds that will not heal
And the rage burns inside
Like a cage that's open wide
Empty now, but once it held
The boundaries of your mind
Privacy and loneliness
They overlap sometimes
Empty now, but once it held
The boundaries of your mind
Privacy and loneliness
They overlap sometimes
And the rage burns inside
Like a cage that's open wide
Empty now, but once it held
The boundaries of your mind
Privacy and loneliness
They overlap sometimes
Save a little of your energy
Spend a little of your time with me
What is it that holds you here to me?"

Days at a time
A malcontent from the look alike ball
And she was mine
She said, ""take all preconceptions,
Tie 'em if you have to with a bow
Leave 'em proud and prominent
In the middle of the busiest road""
A stripper picked me up one night
Down at the ""hideaway jewel""
She just wanted breakfast talk,
She was working her way through school
Talked about her boyfriend
And her second full semester overload
She said, ""some days I feel like I've
Been thrown in to the middle
Of the busiest road""
And I'm riding, only riding
A wreck out on the interstate
And I got out to look
Flares, blood and cassette tapes,
Broken glass by a trivia book
Trooper said she never felt a thing
As far as real trauma goes
Two strangers hold a requiem in the middle
Of the busiest road
And I'm riding, only riding, yeah I'm riding
I'm gonna start a talk show
On a local am station
One in danger of going dark
And I'll pay 'em compensation
Five thousand watts of power freeing
Tales of happenstance untold
Eventually I'll be toll free to

I'm the ultimate, and that's all I can say
I sat down for about eight hours a day
Tryin to figure out the proper description of me
And I came to the decision that there's no one syllable or phrase
That can adequately describe this new craze
But I'll sum it up in one sentence, let's see
Okay I've got it all praise me
Yup that's about the size of it
I know it sounds kinda strange, doesn't it

But I can't quite recall the time exactly
But it was somewhere around, two or three or four
Oh forget it, let's just go on
Anyway I stepped out of school
Sneaks were Gucci shirt was Polo and my pockets were full
Blew some kisses to the girlies cause I like to tease
They started chantin my name, I said, ladies please
I grabbed my friends and hopped in my Benz
Grabbed on Martini and Rossi passed out to my posse
Things were lookin good, I had plans for later on
Plans for Donna Michelle, plans for Stacy LeShaun
Word I was ready, I wonder if Jeff's home
Let me give him a call, on my car phone
Yo Jeff, what's shakin Coolin, whassup
Girlies I'm with it, come pick me up
I caught up with Ready on the way to Jeff's
A whole carload of girlies and they all was def
We walked into Jeff's and said, Girls, you can't resist

Today we don't have a lot of time, so let's not throw it all away
Let's use this time in a very special way
Let's use it, (somethin like this)
I went outside at about 12:30
I saw a couple girlies, and they were lookin pretty good if you know what I mean
So I freshened my breath and stepped on the scene (hit it)
I walked over to em, stepped in between them
One said to the other, I think that I've seen him somewhere before
I said sweetheart, you might have
She said oh yeah it was last night at that party
I said yeah I tried to talk to you there but you were acting as if you were scared
She said I'm not scared now I said Bet, well let's go then
She said but hold up, what about my friend
I said I got a friend
So the three of us left
Went back to my crib and gave a call to Jeff
Five minutes later, Jeff walked in
And I thought to myself yeah, now the fun begins
But the girls started buggin, and they said
Now we want dinner in the best restaurant in town
We want caviar and lobster tails, both by candlelight and Don Perignon I said yeah right
Y'all must be crazy, and Jeff said you know
I really think it's time for these ladies to go
We walked em to the door and told em they were dismissed and it went a little (somethin like this)
But that was okay that was alright
Cause we still had fun that night ya know it
The moral of the story is plain and visible
We always watch out for those kind of women
But the past is the past and the present is the present
And we feel that everyone should be sitting down
(so you all don't miss)
(As we go a little somethin like this, hit it)"

Nothing set in stone
Never try to fool yourself
That you are not alone
Know your place don't chance your arm
Your secrets are all known
Never cross the great divide
Each to his own
Don't misunderstand me, don't be hurt, don't take offence
But what I am about to tell you makes a lot of sense
I've been more than happy with you, loved you as you are
But being happy only takes a restless heart so far
Be thankful for the past but know those times won't come again
I found you quite diverting, even tender now and then
Remember I will always be the first to sing your praise
But I must close the book on our adolescent days
Nothing can be permanent
Nothing set in stone
Never try to fool yourself
That you are not alone
Know your place don't chance your arm
Your secrets are all known
Never cross the great divide

Did you never realise that we are not the same?

67880	Country	"YESTERDAY WHEN I WAS YOUNG
Writers Charles Aznavour, Herbert Kretzmer
Yesterday when I was young the taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue. I teased at life as if it were a foolish game, the way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame. The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned I always built alas on weak and shifting sand. I lived by night and shunned the naked light of the day and only now I see how the years ran away. Yesterday when I was young so many drinking songs were waiting to be sung, so many wayward pleasures lay in store for me and so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see. I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out, I never stopped to think what life was all about and every conversation I can now recall concerned itself with me and nothing else at all. Yesterday the moon was blue and every crazy day brought something new to do. I used my magic age as if it were a wand and never saw the waste and emptiness beyond. The game of love I played with arrogance and pride and every flame I lit too quickly quickly died. The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away and only I am left on stage to end the play. There are so many songs in me that won't be sung; I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue. The time has come for me to pay for yesterday when I was young."

I'll keep my mouth kept shut from under lock and key
That's rusted firm, no lie
Cause all these conversations wind on and on
Drinking champagne from a paper cup
Is never quite the same
And every sip's moving through my eyes
And up into my brain
At half past two, about time to leave
Cause the DJ's playing rhythm and blues
A sad-sorry state, stutter step to those slammin' grooves
As I'm waiting around for you"

Quite the best looking doctor in the state,
He looked after my physical condition
And his bedside manner was great!
When I'd gaze up and see him there above me,
Looking less like a doctor than a Turk,
I was tempted to whisper, ""Do you love me,
Or do you merely love your work?""
He said my bronchial tubes were entrancing,
My epiglottis filled him with glee,
He simply loved my larynx
And went wild about my pharynx,
But he never said he loved me.
He said my epidermis was darling
And found my blood as blue as can be,
He went through wild ecstatics
About my lymphatics,
But he never said he loved me.
And though, no doubt, it was not very smart of me,
I get on a-wracking of my soul,
to figure out why he loved every part of me,
And yet not me as a whole.
By my esophagus he was ravished,
Enthusiastic to a degree,
He said 'twas just enormous,
My appendix vermiformis,
But he never said he loved me.
He said my cerebellum was brilliant,
And my cererum far from N G,
I know he thought a lotta
My medulla oblogota,
But he never said he loved me.
He said my maxillaries were marvels,
And found my sternum stunning to see,
He did a double hurdle
When I shook my pelvic girdle,
But he never said he loved me.
He seemed amused,
When he first made a test of me
To further his medical art;
Yet he refused,
When he's fixed up the rest of me,
To cure that ache in my heart.
I know he thought my pancreas perfect,
And for my spleen was keen as can be,
He said, of all his sweeties,
I'd the sweetest diabetes,
But he never said he loved me."

Forgive every being

Said they got something, some shit
You fucked up when you thought about it

You can't afford, this shits when they land

With a gift they can't undastand, catch it
Cause you came in second
Sure you niggas been feelin' it all day
Cause you niggas been stealin' the whole time
You sippin' on it like the finest wine

Damn, that's my motto until I wake up again
On tha real, fool, mark my eyes, God
Who the most high, shakin' 'em up again

Been there, done done that
Been through the best and I've been through the worse
Made my money on tha first of tha month

Now that the 5th dog is free

Drop 'em your boots Ooo

And I can feel the rain comin'
All in the streets
Washin' all the stains from me
So, so bloody

Wanna bang, bang
Get down for my thang
Then change it back to size
Higher when I realize
Tired of all the lies, surprise
Traveled down the sides
Word to the wise

Flip it with the pie
Welcome to the eye
Kick it with the mind
Back to the ride, to the sky

Remember that die, die, die

Ending in a murder scene
And I'm not such a man
Never been so brave or grand

I had a dream
About a nation that became...
A dazzling sky
The heroes of youth
A burning ache
Resurrecting Truth

I had a dream
About a nation that became...
A guiding hand
Wipes the greed away
A whistle blown
Digs corruption's grave
My dreamy one
I had a dream
About a nation that became...
A jasmine wind
Turns the air so sweet
A cleansing spring
Washes stained elites
Oh, little one
I had a dream
About a nation that became...
A brilliant star
'Bove a poor man's house
A treasure chest
Let the magic out
My dreamy one
I had a dream
Oh, dreamy one, Oh, dreamy one
I had a dream...
This shadow of a man
Had a dream he can't forget
A shadow with a dream
A nation changed, a nation blessed
And let us sing...

Let's make our dreams come true
Lux et Veritas... Victoria
And the dream begins with you

That wasn't made to last
In 1977 - it went fast
Johnny told us to rise
Not to give a shit
And then ""Kiss Me Deadly""
And we had a hit
Last night in the Roxy
We made love on the floor
We shot up in the bathroom
And said we were bored
If you are here tonight
And you hear these sounds
We are still kings & queens of the underground
I don't mean to be profound
But if I'm still around
We are still kings & queens
Of the underground
1984 and ""Rebel Yell"" had the floor
All they said, was ""more more more""
Well I touched you with
My ""Eyes Without A Face""
I was ""Hot In The City""
Yes, I thought I was ace
I didn't know then
When I was in your front room
On MTV, baby
I was high as the moon
If you are here tonight
And you hear these sounds
We are still kings & queens
Of the underground
I don't mean to be profound
But if I'm still around
We are still kings & queens of the underground
Ooh, ooh, golden years
Sold all my vinyl
It went up my arm
And I thought rock and roll
Couldn't do me no harm
Now I'm rolling a joint
And I'm dressed in black
If we lose the music baby
We can never go back
And if you're here tonight
And you hear these sounds
We are still kings & queens of the underground
I don't mean to be profound
But if I'm still around
We are still kings & queens
Of the underground
Jonesy said, ""Bill, don't be profound,
If you are still a king of the underground""
If you hear my voice
And you dig these rebel sounds
Still kings & queens of the underground
Here tonight
I wanna dig these sounds
I'm still a king of the underground
If you hear my voice
Dig these rebel sounds
We're still kings & queens of the underground

I said I got too much love for the mandem
I said I got too much love for the hood rats
I said I got too much love for the mandem
I like cars a lot
Got the same love for them that my father's got
But most cars are second-hand
Been around for a minute, second hand
So you don't know what they've been through
And it's hard to get the facts
Yeah they might look good, but any car can get a wax
Anyway, I like cars a lot
Whenever I pass a shop with reflective windows
I slow down and make a man pass
But here's the problem with second-hand cars
You don't know what they've been through, kinda like people
Some people might look like a Bugatti
But don't get too happy
'Cause they like to move scatty
I call them youths Cat D
Maybe the numbers are good
But it's all messed up under the hood
And anyone can look good with the light off
When you're blind to the fact it's a write-off
See, that's why we don't commit
Girls don't like guys that are broke and shit
Guys don't like girls that are broke and shit
It's a joke, a myth, toke the piff
Fix a cuppa
Might not know what to fix for supper
But I know I don't wanna fix her upper
Can't breed that, I'ma stick to rubber
I'd rather be your distant lover
Than have to be your mister, brother, councilor
And it's all down to the fact my community is full of kids
That either had an absent dad, or a twist up mother
It's hard enough being a bigger brother
But no one wants to live to suffer
So I see Cat D's all over the ends
Most of my friends
'Nuff of these girls have this whole persona
Miss Coca-Cola
Shape like a bottle, face like a model
But your strengths be where your weaknesses from
'Cause your empty when the sweetness is gone
And you don't see this as wrong
All of these playas got so much game
So how come the team isn't strong
She was like, ""Fuck if his penis is long,
If his cream isn't long""
Go for the guys whose Ps is long
He'll take you back when you treat him wrong
Even when he gets cheated on
'Cause he can't see that you're a Cat D
Until I roll past with my one, straight from the factory
And in the meantime there's all these guys on the road going gym
Looking fly but they don't know a thing
To an extent you wanna suck
But, really you give them brain cause they're dumb as fuck
I got too much love for these hood rats
I got too much love for the mandem
I will never live life like them
But that's the my peoples, I understand them
I said I got too much love for these hood rats
Too much love for the mandem
I will never live life like them
But that's the my peoples
I got too much love for these hood rats
I got too much love for the mandem
I will never live life like them
But that's the my peoples, I understand them

When you goona give me a call
Because you dont know what to do, you follow men in suits, who tell you Everything is all cool
Verse 3:
I want more than this
Something without tricks
Something of my own
I want you to see
Something more than dreams
That ends with being asleep, by the TV screen
coz they flash and gleam
Make nothing what it seems
Is this really what we,
wanted,
after all?"

15797	Rock	"I drove a long, long way without drinking
I listened to the Baptist Radio
There was a blue-gray sky as I passed the ghost town by
And headed down to where nobody knows me
I was jaded by another passing lover
I couldn't bring myself to wonder why
And the man on the radio said
?Hey, don't you wanna got down to Deliverance Road??
I saw three little birds sitting on a doorstep
And two little boys in their Sunday best
And the preacher?s voice was strong
The big lady sang along, as I listened
Rolling down Deliverance Road, Deliverance Road
I may never walk through the gates of heaven
I may never hear the angel?s serenade
But when the wind picks up and drags the dust
I'm gonna stop my car, look straight up
And the rain might wash my sins away
But after all the trucks stops
And tumble weeds have faded
And the radio sings a country song
I?ll still hear the preacher ma
Doing the best that he can
To send us down Deliverance Road
Deliverance Road"

Jelousy will destroy us or so she used to say
You'd kill for half the things we do including yesterday
But I suppose you know because your went to school with me
You sit in ya garage and you'd see
All the things we do don't you! no you didn't and no you don't
No you didn't and no you don't. no you don't!

That was us and no one else
Lend luke a jumper off the shelf
Do you remember us lot doing keys
In the back of the garage where no one sees
That was us, no one else another jager off the shelf

I can remember sometimes
I could just stand off all by myself
And just get funky listenin' to the train

And throw 'em down on the ground for ties

And you're not missing much
There's something pure
That you can't hold against a simple touch
So many choices and the pressure
We all bring to bear
Your strength works miracles
And touches those who try to care
I believe in you
And I hope you see it through
Your resolve is inspiration in my life
It takes a lot now
So few who feel the same
When it means enough
Not to give it away now
Finding it hard
Not to think in terms of yesterday
Finding it strange
That somebody else could feel that way
It must be hard sometimes
To stand behind your chastity
And I wish that I could be the one
But it's not me I'll never set you free
Hold on because you've got a lot to believe in"

Then I'll lose my love
Then I'll sit in silence
Let the pictures soak

Float across the room
Whisper into one ear
And out the other one
Then I'll take my clothes off
And I'll walk around
Because it's so nice outside
And I like the way the sun feels
And when it's dark
I'll call out in the night for my mother
But she isn't coming back for me
'Cause she's already gone
But you will not tell me that
'Cause you know it hurts me every time you say it
And you know you're doing the right thing
You must know you're doing the right thing

SONG LYRICS
Get a load of that with the snakeskins on
Looks like a refugee from a head bangin' song
Sweet July evening, seems all the world we've ever known
Is here at the breaker, shakin' them restless bones
Brown baggin' as the music's draggin' on a cheap cassette machine
Honey, I know no matter where we go
We're gonna keep us a piece of this routine
Chorus:
Like a rembrandt....
A one of a kind in a shades-of-grey world
Like a rembrandt, baby.......
A genuine find in a come and go swirl
World's in the moonlight, there's diamonds in the coal
Layin' on my hood we're runnin' soul in soul
Yellin' out my name, I think I know who that was
This moment's got me higher than a black coffee buzz
Come on girl, you can call your boss and fake a case of the flu
You and me, we can cast some shadows
In that nightlight your mama left on for you
Repeat Chorus
Drinkin' domestic on a night as majestic
As a true hell raiser's bliss
Every workin' day they take a little more away
But they don't know of a social affair as redeeming as this
Same tapes as last week, but that makes 'em cool
Same grooves, same times, drives the social tool
If this here is heaven then the saints are reelin'
Some of them crawlin' on a tall grass ceilin'
Honey, if life don't give us any more - it gave us a season
To groove 'neath the stars at the number 9 breaker
Not askin' for answers or reasons
Repeat Chorus

Straight down and dirty for my props
Eleven years old, extra-manish, hard-headed sellin' rocks

Prettiest thing I ever seen, a 1979 air fifteen
Clean, fully automatic and the whole killer kit
It's cops be walkin' up and down the street
Folks be pointin' they fingers sayin' ""Partner gotta grip""

And turn me like I was a sucker
So slow ya lil' ass down on this side of town
Before you find yourself either melted or beat down
Like that and that's on the goose my brother
Because now days a dollar comes harder than a motherfucker
So if you out in that world don't get caught or be slippin'
Cause today's society ain't trippin'

Toy stores are out of control, and kids singing
That night before Christmas, dashing through the snow
Rudolph the Reindeer, red nose that glow
It's all about the candycanes and Christmas list
North Pole and that chubby jolly old Saint Nick
The little elves getting busy, in Santa workshop
And how gingerbread men keep they buttons on top
Wooden soldiers and chestnuts, rosting like marshmellows
Goodfellas, chocolate pudding pops and Jell-O's
It's the gift, the cookies and milk on the mantle
The mistletoe, that scent from that peppermint candles
That warm French vanilla, mean coat with zippers
Bareskin robe dragon with Versace slippers
Around the fireplace we breathe, shirts are short sleave
We stayin' up all night on Christmas Eve

Buy gifts for your loved ones and diamonds for ya wiz

Sisters and brothers, sliding down garbage can covers
Snowball fights, eggnog splashed with Hennessey
Bet Christmas is Christmas from New York to Tennessee

All them late nights wrapping gifts, driving you crazy
And Jack Frost is outside, freezing it up
Got the hood and the goose just to loosen you up
And all the homes is all lit with some many lights
See the trees through the windows, glittered up at night
Gingerbread house, bumping that Jingle Bell Rock
And all them little bad kids get coal in they socks

Ghost knows when you be sleeping
And Ghost knows when you are awake
And I know if you been bad or good
So be good for old Ghostface

107675	Rock	"Qu triste se nos fue la vida
Atras del cielo nos miran llorar
Fumando lunas a escondidas
Revoloteando entre viejas paredes
Qu triste se nos fue la vida
La lluvia acida mojaba octubre
Y de rodillas vuelan lamentos
De algunos buitres de algunos cerdos
Avientame
Avientame hasta donde quieras
Y luego ven a mirar como revivo
Avientame
Avientame hasta donde quieras
Y luego ven a mirar como no muero
Como aguanto
Qu tristes senos tiene carmela
El silicon le ha roto el corazn
Y ahora llora como ernesto
Que se ha castrado por falta de amor
Avientame
Avientame hasta donde quieras
Y luego ven a mirar como revivo
Avientame
Avientame hasta donde quieras
Y luego ven a mirar como no muero
Como aguanto"
152410	Pop	"Spring was never waiting for us 'til it ran one step ahead
As we followed in the dance
MacArthur's park is melting in the dark
All the sweet green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it 'cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again, oh, no
I recall the yellow cotton dress foaming like a wave
On the ground beneath your knees
Birds like tender babies in your hands
And the old men playing Chinese checkers by the trees
MacArthur's park is melting in the dark
All the sweet green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it 'cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again, oh, no"
234704	Rock	"I barely lived today
It isn't fair
I barely live the day to the night
I lost my hope today
It isn't fair
That I don't live or die
I walk alone at night
My worried mind
Will kill me if I think very long
But I feel this world
In final evil days
I guess that God wasn't wrong
I can feel the worldspinning
I can feel that something's going wrong
I can feel the worldspinning
And I'm afraid it won't be very long
I'm the devil's prey
And I can see
The devil has his way with a man
The end is gonna be bad bad bad
I've gotta quit while I can
Winter turned too cold
The summer burned
And the country died
The people didn't care
Just as long
As their TV's worked alright
I can live, I can choose,
I get naked with the muse
I can change, I can fly, I can reach a natural high
I get marked, I can jam, I can try to give a damn
I can play, I can lay on a system in decay
I get cool, I could show you but it probably doesn't matter"

I swear my nerves are showing
Set your hopes up way too high

I've been waiting long for one of us to say
Save the darkness, let it never fade away
Ah, ah, the living daylights
Ah, ah, the living daylights
All right, hold on tight now
It's down, down to the wire
Set your hopes way too high
The living's in the way we die

Hundred thousand changes, everything's the same
I've been waiting long for one of us to say
Save the darkness, let it never fade away

I ain't looking for nothing necessarily,
Then in you sauntered in.
You were too cool, too suave.
The way you handled your guitar.
When you started to play,
You nearly stole my heart away.
You can't stop fate stepping in.
You can try, but you'll give in.
When you finished playing, ooh you caught my eye.
I don't usually get so humble, I don't usually get so shy.
But when you asked my name. I felt the deepest shame.
If you could read my mind, oh, you'd see my crime.
You can't stop fate stepping in.
You can try, but you'll give in.
You can't choose. You can't lose.
You can't hide. You can't decide.
You can't run, You can't shun.
You can't escape, destiny of fate.
You can't stop fate stepping in.
You can try, but you'll give in"

Hear my words in yout mind
Hear me speak without tunes
From the endless worlds of fire
I have found you
I'm now the tormentor of your soul
Wherever you may hide
I will turn light for you to darkness
Ancient spirits
Created by evil
Follow my voice
I can see destruction from a different side now
When the demons have drowned my mind
You can't hide in the darkness
If you don't belong to it"
321074	Rock	"I stand next to an empty grave
Where my friends will lay
I'll put their bodies down
Into their resting place.
Got a purple heart
For a wound and scar
They just send letters home
That broke the families apart.
The paulbearers burden
As heavy as my hearts hurting.
All the pain and guilt
My head is pondering.
Why them and not me?
Why them and not me?
Why?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Means another poor boy is in the ground.
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
Means another poor boy is dead and gone.
Have you ever heard that coffin sound?
Means another poor boy is in the ground.
The preachers preach, only folded flags
And the mothers mourn, holding folded flags.
Just caskets and folded flags.
Just caskets and folded flags.
No hope, just folded flags.
No hope, just folded flags.
No hope
No hope
No hope
No hope"

I'll spend thinking of you when you're not here
How many times will I think about the things
I'd like to do
Always denied the right to live my life the way I want
I want to share it with you
Close your eyes
I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes
I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams
I'll think of your kiss as the days roll by
And I'll write the words you love
What I can't say in a letter
Will just have to wait till I get home
There's not much time to tell you
Half the things I should
Only that I'm so glad I fell in love with you
And I'd do it again if I could
Close your eyes
I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes
I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams
Sleep like a child resting deep
You don't know what you give me I keep
For these moments alone"

I was always one for curly hair
Made a mess of this whole love affair
Working hard you burn the midnight oil
Wear your hat is made of tin foil
Verse 1:
Turn up to your door
In the middle of the night
Singing oooooooh
Try and go on the run with no flash light
Singing oooooooh
Chorus:
She says that we're not in love
We're only dating
I say that I'm getting tired of the waiting
She says that we're not in love
It makes me sick
Verse 2:
Hit the window with a stone on your birthday
Saying ooooooooh
We laugh at the notes and all the word play
Saying ooooooooh
Chorus:
She says that we're not in love
We're only dating
I say that I'm getting tired of the waiting
She says that we're not in love
It makes me sick
Bridge:
Meditation
Just can't help me anymore
At the station
It's me you're looking for
Chorus:
She says that we're not in love
We're only dating
I say that I'm getting tired of the waiting
She says that we're not in love
It makes me sick

86209	Rock	"Drinking a Familiar ale
As I listen to a tale
Of a friendship that was won and lost
A long time ago
Well I always got to roam, nowhere to call my home
Cause I've been here and I've been there
And I know that I just don't care
Cause it makes no sense to me all your fucking schemes
And all your hopes and dreams they got wasted at the seams
'Cause your life was just a stepping stone to me
And what you thought meant a lot ain't shit to me
Cause I'll put on a mask to perform a task
and see how long I can make it last
With a tear and a promise I would never leave
Guess I lost my friends there's no one left to depend on
All those things I said I'd be what's it all worth without your family
Cause now you're all alone you'll always have to roam
Driven from the pack, we had your back
Because we had the loyalty that you lacked
'Cause my life was just a stepping stone to you
And I've got news baby, you and I are through
And if you don't understand it, let me make it crystal clear
You'd better just get the fuck right out of here."
295195	Rock	"I was waiting
Watching every single move
On the wire I cling to
Had a feeling
Like a cold and empty room
There was nothing left to lose
And I know, I know you're waiting
I'll see you again if it's the last thing I can do
I know, I know it's all that's true
I was wasted
Without everything I knew
I was lost without a clue
I know, I know you're waiting
I'll see you again if it's the last thing I can do
I know, I know it's all that's true
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
And I wandered so far, and it brought me back to you
And I screamed at the sky, and it turned from black to blue
And I know, I know you're waiting
I'll see you again if it's the last thing I can do
I know, I know it's all that's true, that's true, that's true!
That's true! That's true! That's true!
That's true! That's true! That's true!
Now I'm weightless
Staring out across the view
Over mountains, I can't move"

The sun stares at my eyes.
And here, does it matter if I fear now?"
72895	Rock	"a face that shaped dreams
lost in a broken frame
the colour is fading but for now
it seems all the same
the smile i loved in the mornings
now miles away
once restrained and then winning
once so open and next discreet
hear the drizzle of the rain
the window's creaking
are there foot-steps in the hall
no a tap must be leaking; I'm lonely!
all these noisy little nothings silly nothings drive me insane: it's scaring
can you imagine just how i feel
i'm slipping, i'm drowning
can't help it can't stop it can't i believe in something
can't help it can't stop it can't i believe in something
can't help it can't stop it can't i believe in something
can't help it can't stop it can't i believe in something
the bit of certainty i had
undermined and shaken: It's Fading!
the walls of sand are finally breaking
i'm slipping, i'm drowning
can't help it can't stop it can't i believe in something
can't help it can't stop it can't i believe in something
can't help it can't stop it can't i believe in something
can't help it can't stop it can't i believe in something
nothing is collapsing it's all unchanged
but it is stuck on a broken frame
there's still a balance that will remain
and won't slip out of a broken frame
no further will i drift away
abandoning my course: I stop it now
i'll catch a wave back to the shore not so far away: I stop now
can't help it can't stop it can't i believe in something
can't help it can't stop it can't i believe in something
can't help it can't stop it can't i believe in something
can't help it can't stop it can't i believe in something
can't help it can't stop it can't i believe in something

We going crazy and I always use my best sense
But it don't matter cause I stay on my fresh prince
Maxin', relaxin, shootin' some pool and
Playing some b-ball outside of the school and
Girls with they top off outside of the pool and
Whips with the drop off outside of the Louvre

And parties at Richie is getting risky

Voices in my head, I need choices in my bed
AHHHHH, get out my fucking head
It's just me and my bad bitch
So you can say I'm on my Brad Pitt
Back to the la familia I'm aligned with
Before I betray them I slit my wrists
At the top is just us nigga
Cause I don't really trust niggas
And we made it through the hurricane
So celebrate and light the Mary Jane
We gon' make it, that's on everything
Truest girls get half naked, every spring
They saying, ""Hey Kanye
We need you to go deeper than Tay Zonday,""
Cause my verses got pain, Chocolate Rain
So many lines, you photograph and it make arms break
On the radio, man I miss myself
I need to just step back and kiss myself
Baby, just step up and kiss the belt
A little lower.. that's what's up
Somebody pour her another cup
Is it too much to ask you keep your diamonds up?
I swear until my time is up
My style is sex in the shower, fresh as fuck
So shine bright tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Feel the warmth we'll never die

You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky
I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh right away
At first sight I felt energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes
So shine bright tonight you and I

All booked up on depression and self-loathing.
Buried deep in sleep from passing out, no time to plan ahead.
Someone please tell me, why do i think this way?
Someone please tell me that this isn't the end of everything.
A chemical imbalance? No. The smell of my own vomit lost in my last tears.
No more kissing clocks or throwing coins into wishing wells to try and fix the way I fucked myself.
When it's finally here, it's never enough and when it's finally gone, it's never coming back.
Somehow I fooled myself into believing that this would work out, that I wouldn't end up hurt."

No matter where you're from and where you go
There's a place for all of you

I script you your obituary then blow like a missile
Once I blow the whistle, motherfuck may the forces be with you
Come with a style, I'm wildin', pile up my money so kosher,
Then call up the sofa fuckin' bitches in back of the rover
Then bounce with the coca, bag up bitches outside of the costa rica area level,

While helpin' you grow up, niggas know you for soundin' so tore up

I probably been proper since my papa put dick in my mommy
I'm a cannon man
Holdin' the hamma man
For the loot niggas shoot niggas like a camera man
Snappin' a picture, you get stuck like the back of a sticker
I got bars like the factory manufacturing snickers
And I do crimes for the bread like croutons
With two nines I be layin' clowns down like foutons
With the bullets in the rocket, my pockets is full of cream
I'm blowin' steam keep the steel in my hands like wolverine
Poppin' the metal, you niggas is not on my level

I'm the code of silence in the gotti crew

Got something sup? shotgun pump, shot at you
Like kamakize through, your baby mom's feel the wop cock back
Cause she was sittin' on my lap
I stay with the oowap strap
I put your baby daddy in a body bag
When I squeeze and let the wop clap

71116	Metal	This is chaos theory simplified and stretched out before a jury. No warning has been issued. No compliments have been wholesomely handed out. The time hasn't been used up until it burns. Fear the wounded for they walk the earth stronger. Destroy the loathsome for they only weaken the machine. Running the tightrope until the rope runs out. Run it all into the ground then rebuild. The constructs on the boundaries we've been given are unfair. And mother earth doesn't love you. Our remorse has gone far beyond forgiveness. Until the rope runs out. Run it all into the ground. For when in Rome we shall do as the Romans.

Give the minimum away.
By the Thames's turbid waters
Men abruptly tumble down.
Is it plague or is it cholera?
Or a sign Macheath's in town?
On a beautiful blue Sunday
See a corpse stretched in the Strand.
See a man dodge round the corner...
Mackie's friends will understand.
And Schmul Meier, reported missing
Like so many wealthy men:
Mac the Knife acquired his cash box.
God alone knows how or when.
Jenny Towler turned up lately
With a knife stuck through her breast
While Macheath walks the Embankment
Nonchalantly unimpressed.
Where is Alfred Gleet the cabman?
Who can get that story clear?
All the world may know the answer
Just Macheath has no idea.
And the ghastly fire in Soho -
Seven children at a go -
In the crowd stands Mac the Knife, but he

Well she went and dipped it in her Crisco can
And turned that sum-a-bitch on
Well she hummed and a wiggled, squirmed and giggled
Collapsed into utter pleasures

She swears it's an American dream

It's guaranteed to make you cream in your jeans

A 12 - inch wonder that the mailman had brought
But through her love she could not see,
What a terrible fate there was to be.
Well she found her answer to all of her dreams
In a battery operated sex machine
Man nor beast could take it's place
She was destined to die with a smile on her face

I don't care what you have planned
Jessica suicide, never even tried
But I gave in to her demands
Death threats, regrets
Go ahead I heard all you've said
Cause bitter always becomes bland
Cause bitter always becomes bland
Cause bitter always becomes bland
Cause bitter always becomes bland
So scared to characterize
I've always known your cold eyes
And now I fully realize
I just can't take this deadly surprise
This time she'll do it
Too late my bus is leaving
I don't care what she has planned
I don't care what she has planned

Paying no mind to the signs
Well, this neighborhood's changed
It's all been rearranged
We left that dream somewhere behind.
Slow down, you're gonna crash,
Baby you're a-screaming it's a blast, blast, blast
Look out babe, you've got your blinders on
Everybody's looking for a way to get real gone
Real gone.
Real gone.

He's got high-faded friends
Thinks he's gonna change history
You think you know him so well

But you can't say it 'round here
'Cause they'll catch you and give you a whippin'
Well, I believe I was right when I said you were wrong
You didn't like the sound of that
Now, did ya?
Slow down, you're gonna crash,
Baby you're a-screaming it's a blast, blast, blast
Look out, you've got your blinders on

Rising from your lips towards the window
The sunlight is twisting lines in my eyes
Leaving me far too dizzy, to see

What am I supposed to say?
No one ever listens, anyway
I want to forgive, and I want to forget
But I can't seem to break out of this, yet
As I'm haunted by heartache and visions of things
That widens, the gulf, between us

Number one MC in the world, a.k.a. Dr. Dooom
Straight out of solitary
I got the block locked down
Transfer me to conquer in the Pelican Bay
You don't want to step in my cell
I eat your ass for real
Even veterans go out with tight pants and lipstick
Most rappers flex up, they vexed up, they actin hard
Attendin Catholic school at mom's house, they soft as lard
They roll in packs, carryin yo-yo's, and balls and jacks
That kid you peeped it, his boys wearin Victoria's Secret
Mean mugs get crushed up, your bra's showin, pickin dust up
You light your trees up, I'm just the man to skin yo' knees up
Walk behind you, tuck your stomach in, I redesign you
Urgent emergency, your girl is cryin, they can't find you
I move with bowling ball bags, you try to ask for Zig-Zags
You got your panties on with wigs on, why'all playin tag
Walkin in tough kid, your girdle's showin, watch your doo-rag
G-strings get touched, watch your skid marks like Starsky and Hutch
why'all scope erections, while rappers run to different sections
I ride in limos pull your thongs in, from here to Wisconsin
Droppin this A-bomb make, tough MC's, put on Avon
Eject your wigs in Hunts Point, your pumps in truckers rigs
Chorus: repeat 4X
I'm the man of the hour
Watchin girls takin a shower
I run rap, tell MC's to watch their back

Rappers with panty-liners, rent cars, with no recliners
I get ill, serve the best MC's with Massengil
While crowds chill, take your haltertops, down to Big Bill
Right on your mic stand, your flower shorts, you've been hurt
Male with a dildo, your ass is low, call policemen
Three million rappers on labels, sportin skirts release men
I teach men, pull my pants down, piss on each men
Frustrate the rectums on the night flight, I cruise on East and
look at your contracts, while Vaseline, smears your buttcrack
I counteract tracks, while you ate rhymes smokin crack
Skinny kid two pounds, with phony legs, bustin two rounds
That man is slinky, jacks off, and rappers host his Twinkie
Underarm smell, keep the mics warm, why'all shirts is stinky
Panties look great on you with wedding rings around your pinkie
Now stop BS then cut your weight down, you'd be like Vester
Facin your whole crew, with cardinals on like Uncle Fester
Lo-lo-lo-Lopez, your moms call me Frankie Sanchez
On deck with penis out, pine tar like Tony Perez
Big battin average, send your girlfriend out, tossin salad
I run rap, tell MC's to watch their back
Chorus

Rappers get maxi-pads and O.B., their time of the month
No time for phone calls from tough guys, why'all puff them blunts
Some serious stretch marks, cock-diesel MC's end up pregnant
Nine months in time stuck, you rhyme, grabbin inmates jock
Sportin your white dress, with Timberlands, you try to impress
Petrol with bulletproof vest, your man is havin incest
Knock up your celldon, your big group, they roll with Alvin
Drag queen on Front Street, program, all your SP-12 beats
why'all roll up dust, smokin PCP, I come with big heat
why'all run why'all knowledge down, send your Rolex down to Big Pete
Lipstick is smeared on, your Pele shirt, get your fear on
Hard rappers with stockings and tunafish, smell like Starkist
I call him Miss, rappers tampons, I bought it for Christmas
I call you Anna make you sniff balls, back to Atlanta
Change all your grammar and have you call home, bleedin to Grandma
I run rap, tell MC's to watch their back

That we'll be

In love
Then you shold know
I have no regrets
It was too damn hard
When push came to shove
I packed up
Your things
I have enough
In my dreams
Pictures fade
And love remains
Until the day
You're here again
I always loved your beautiful smile
The sparkle in your eyes, and the funny things you'd do
I'm sorry that things turned out the way they did
I'd do it all again, for another night with you
You necklace reminds me
Of everything we did
It's stupid
I know
But I'll still wonder
If you'd invite me
To your wedding
Because I'd really like to go
A bruised heart
Your hurt pride
It won't be

It's all been done
Not why but how
Don't look back

Song's over now, my comfort is gone

Used to bring her flowers every night
Just to please her

Gives us love to keep us together
When life gets like a ship on a raging sea
And when the stage of life grows cold
Somebody helps us to play our role
If God is dead who's this living in my soul
If my soul had windows
I'd leave them open so the world could see
The ugly scars upon those hands
That bled for you and me

Of love and pain
Under the gentle arches we rode
The silver streets
Couldn`t see a difference between gold or
Wooden cross
Could never see where we`re falling
Came in to love
Then hounded by love
Hounded by the very thing you dreamed up
Chased inside the walls you tried to breach
Sent crashing to your knees
Only tender love
Understood the need you need with
Understood the time it took
To take you where nothing ever was
Never was there once nothing
And everything once was
Not dead but still and ready to be born anew
Looking back now it all
Seems so clear
Like staring so long unseeing for someone to light inside a
Darkened room
Then try your tender love
Push you back till there`s nowhere left
Nowhere to feel nothing anymore
Nothing that will comfort you more
More than tender love
Understands the need you need with
Understand the time it takes to get home and have a love again
More than tender love
Understands the need you need with
Understand the time it takes
To get home and have a love
Then try your tender love
Push it till there`s nothing left
Nowhere to feel nothing anymore
Nothing that will comfort you more
Then hounded by love
Hounded by the very thing you dreamed up
Chased inside the walls you tried to breach
Sent crashing to your knees
Then only tender love
Understood the need you need with
Understood the time it took
To take you where nothing ever was"

Are hard to take back once the damage is done

I'm gonna love you, for all that it's worth
And one of these days, we're gonna understand why.
Let's make the most of our time
As long as we're here (Yeah)
Some people live their lives
Holding their fears, inside them
Afraid to build windows
To let the light of the world in.
They hide in the darkness of self-imposed walls
If they could just tear them down, they'd have it all

As long as we're here (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
When you're with me, I breathe easy

You're the one who's going to face him toe to toe
Wipe that grin right off his face
And whip this army into shape

And I'm gonna make you king

Making plans for your big wedding day
You and Joseph are gonna be
The picture perfect family
Maybe a couple of kids down the road
But I've been thinking
Even before time began
I had a picture perfect plan
Of how to save this broken world
Through the life of just one man
I'm gonna send my only Son
And Mary, you're the one
You were right about one thing
You're gonna have that family
And you're gonna raise a King

My mass grows endlessly
Beauty there is to see
But I'm abused, there is no clarity
Defaced what I might be
Defined the grace in me
The sleeping beast throws shadows towards me
Aeon:
The untaught world in silence sleeps
While night and day embrace so deep
Between the line of dawn and dark
Embedded -- a threat waiting for a spark
Fate:
The tears I cry are endlessly
The sorrow I saw burns so eternally
They call on me, no mercy though
For there's no remorse for the fallen ones
Temptation:
There's no light in me
The chance to be
If you reach out and want to see
Morning star:
I rise and shine, whatever comes
Guiding the way through the light of dawn
The darkness I dispel,
Who's willing to awake and see
Will be led to infinity
Aeon:
Years melt away, the mother creeps
Though they seem to be in untroubled sleep
The darkness' sheet drowns a tender weep
Doom crawls up drawn by the storm gathering
Fate:
The sleeping beast fastens it's beat
And destiny loosens the iron leash
Just one more surge and he'll break free
But I take my course to eternity
Morning star:
I rise and shine, whatever comes
Guiding the way through the light of dawn
The morning star outshines the pain
Gleaming in eternal holy flames
The darkness I dispel, who's willing
To awake and see
Will be lead to infinity"

Don't let him do to you what he did to me
Thought I told you that, he would break your heart
He was no good for you, from the start
Thought I told you that, he had another girl
You're not the only woman in his world

And nothing that he says will make me want him back
It does matter what he sends me
A dozen flowers or a diamond that's bling bling

Though I wore you glacial patience to a smudge of bitter dust
On the last day you embraced me with a glistening sapling trust
Did they sing a million blessings as they watched us slowly part

Our backs against the wall
If my heart wasn't in it

347058	Pop	"One day I decided I'd aspire to higher ambition
So I set out on a mission to change the world
Armed and dangerous with my well meant words and best intentions
I went sharing my convictions with every livin' soul
But it wasn't long 'til the lightning flashed
The storms of disenchantment crashed
And my ambitions were scattered by winds of doubt
And it wasn't long 'til I learned ot see
Life wouldn't always be easy for me
So I wrote a little song to remind myself"
200228	Metal	"He's building a mountain for you
You're so filled with your self,
Never wrong always right
Always the winner in your own little world,
Fantastic, Always on top
Well, The bigger the ego the harder the fall,
Please man, are you for real
Your myths and your lies
really makes my eyes bleed,
Delude your surroundings
Pretending to be something that you're not,
You're only...
Deceiving your self
Hypocritical liar,
To believe in your self
you're a slender messiah
Take credit from others,
Steal your ideas,
Duplicate with no remorse
Try to see,
The world isn't in orbit around you,
Even when we have seen
The true nature of your scheme,
you're still pretending
you're something you're not
You're only
Slender messiah
the god when all else has failed
Building a mountain,
By using small fragments of truth
The joke is on you!"

Why do I keep asking myself?
Where are you heading like a tumbleweed?
Like a rock that falls down the cliff?
You are wasting everything!
I find it hard to believe but youll always have a chance to turn over a new leaf
Were stuck between our desires
Were taking hold of ourselves
But maybe thats not the key
Thats simply another deadlock
Another delusion
We fucked up!
What if were doomed?
Whaaaaaaaaat?
The outcome is close!
It will show you the truth!
I know that sucks to be kept in the dark!
Were taking hold of ourselves
But maybe thats not the key
Thats simply another deadlock

We are free to choose and believe in what we want to believe
And hope that we have one more endeavour! (x3)"

And we're at the top of the town and don't you think we're not
Well we found love and happiness people envy us you see
For we found heaven right here on earth at 4-0-33
Yes we found what most people are looking for
And it's not a lotta money to spend on real fine car
But it's so when and where a bird flies and sings so free
And there's whole lotta winds in this little house at 4-0-33
Four thousandth block proves what true love can do
Once a lonely place but was sold to me and you
Oh all around the house you can see little children play
But they're not as a people's kids were proud to say
They are the symbol of our love for all the world to see
They're a part of heaven right here on earth at 4-0-33

Our love's on the day you can see many people drive by
For look at the house they think there from the sky
They think this place would make them as happy as you and me
And the whole town's tryin' to buy our house at 4-0-33
Four thousandth block proves what true love can do...

If it's rain they anticipate
Baby make no mistake
Yes the storm will break but never me you see.
Two years on two years on
But only you can see me.
Only you can see me.

Crystal shimmer in your mind
To the first time when you saw her
You implored her to be kind
In the open fields around you
All before you gone to ground
Both the question and the answer
Deep inside you, you shall find
And while you're strollin'
Through the summer of your years
Enchanted, a garden overgrown
Don't call me sentimental
Those of you who care
Could find there a lover and a friend to the end
And if you're taken
By the spirit of your age
No reason to carve the cornerstone
Sway me, trade me
Your philosophy
First you're sowin', then you're growin'
Then you reap until you sleep
Will you scale the silver studded mountain?
Where contemplation will spring to mind
See the veiled prophet's withered gaze reflect the 'Nouvelle-vague'
Glazed visions imprisoned in your mind
Unwinding rivers flowing through the meadows to the sea
Paths of glory through shifting glades to fall
Present laughter and the memory of troubles you have seen
It is written in your mind"

299512	Hip-Hop	"She had the sweetest scent I ever smelt a woman have
Skin would glisten like reflections off the blueish Jag
She had a Jewish dad, and a Jamaican maid
Started hanging with strippers and dropping the zippers
And selling the pussy for paper to play
Crusty feet like she hiking for days and live in the mountains
At the park she piss in the fountain, shit on the Michigan towel
She quick to split up an owl
She loves some dick in her bowels
Dabble in crystal, polish the pistol, powder her sniffles with flour
Straight flieshman
In the private part of her pussy pocket
Randomly pussy farting
Sold at the hookers auction
Left as a crooked orphan
Wrapped in the sports section
Box score, fake black rubber cock in the top drawer, what
Make this fucking bitch sit in vinegar
Apple cider baths
Sit in the vinegar
Bronsolino
PS
Yo, so many unfamiliar faces that have come and gone
You're a constant, fucked you in the school closet
We were young then, experimental periods
Laid a towel cause I fucked you on your period
Stole my mothers car crashed it by the Burger King
Young love, but we thought it was eternity
Raw sex, never thought about paternity
But now this cunt is trying to murder me
Abusing me physically and verbally
Said my dick was too small
I went and got the surgery, just to show it off
This ain't real shit, baby, I'm just going off
Clear the mind, fuck it, so I wrote a song
Night life, I'm destined for the bright lights
Knife fights at the bar with some white dykes
She hold me down, break a bottle on the bitch head
.25 out the pussy and it spits lead
We always end up in a situation
She throwing diapers out the window at me
Called the cops said I beat her face
Beat the case, now I shiver at a sweet embrace
I rap now, bitches sucking like a vacuum
On the bed, stay bent like a smack spoon
Bubble butt thicker than the double dutch
In the van, leave her tied up in bumblefuck
Cold, tired and I mean it
I thought we'd grow to old farts in Phoenix
Well now you see me 'lo scarves and a ski knit
But I've been here since the beginning, like a prefix
But I'mma to do what I gotta do
Trying to make this french dough like a PÃ¢te Ã  Choux
Over your head, after sex shorty hold me in bed
Smoking Ethiopian red
The son goes, a single teardrop fallopians bled
Nowadays you catch the hooker sniffing coke in the shed
It's a damn shame I'm just chilling eating lamb brain
I keep the weiner on display for the campaign
I'm just doing what I had to do
Tryna Drop me in the ground but I'm not going
To the top till I fall just like Owen
Heartbreak drowned sorrows in a love state"
196745	Pop	"across the children close, beyond the faces where I hide
in this empty torn up word, this creeping deep inside
this heaven swims into the blue you know I still look up to you
in love in everything you do, in every everything you do
render me in shadow, hold me in the face of a girl
when the marching men are drawing shades around your useless empty world
no love no more no reasons for
no hope no light no open doors
no words no consequences
no truth no pride no elegances
the storm of pain in coming soon to make these lies pull down the moon
all that you love sets down below and drowning fast in the undertow
on comet's tails we're breaking free from what's to come, from what will be
we know just where we want to go, for all of you, you'll never know
(she will be more than all you are, she'll never see your falling star)
where no shadows block the sun
where no hope is lost, where no rivers run
where the sun blooms for just one day
where we find the place, a winter hideway
forevermore I live this day
I let my ashen graces down, and pull my heart up from the ground
just for one chance to shine brighter than a thousand suns
for love, for truth that now is gone
I once was lost, but now am found
was blind but now I see
and for rhiannon is my elation
and for the lost ones there is nothing
and for rhiannon is my elation
and for the father there is nothing..."

What's it like in New York City?
I'm a thousand miles away
But girl, tonight you look so pretty
Yes you do
Times Square can't shine as bright as you
I swear it's true
Hey there, Delilah
Don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely
Give this song another listen
Close your eyes
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise
I'm by your side
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me

I know times are getting hard
But just believe me, girl
Someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar
We'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good
Hey there, Delilah
I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you
Would take your breath away
I'd write it all
Even more in love with me you'd fall
We'd have it all
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
A thousand miles seems pretty far
But they've got planes and trains and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
and we'll just laugh along because we know
That none of them have felt this way
Delilah, I can promise you
That by the time that we get through
The world will never ever be the same
And you're to blame
Hey there, Delilah
You be good and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school
And I'll be making history like I do
You'll know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to
Hey there, Delilah, here's to you
This one's for you
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me

Put the mask upon the face just to make the next day
Feds be hawkin me
Jokers be stalking me
I walk the streets and camouflage my identity
My posse in the Brooklyn wear the mask
My crew in the Jersey wear the mask
Stick up kids doing boogie woogie wear the mask
Yeah everybody wear the mask but how long will it last
I used to work at Burger King. A king taking orders
Punching my clock. Now I'm wanted by the manager
Soupin me up sayin ""You're a good worker,""
""How would you like a quarter raise, move up the register""
""Large in charge, but cha gotta be my spy
Come back and tell me who's baggin my fries
Getting high on company time.""
Hell no sirree, wrong M.C
Why should I be a spy, when you spying me
And you see whatcha thought ya saw but never seen
Ya missed ya last move, Checkmate! Crown me King
Pulled my 22 pistol whipped him in his face
Hired now I'm fired, sold bud now I'm wired
Eyes pitch red but da beat bop my head
Hit the streets for relief, I bumped into the Feds
I got kidnapped they took me to D.C.
Have me working underground building missiles for World War III

My posse Uptown wear the mask
My crew in the Queens wear the mask
Stick up kids with the Tommy Hil wear the mask
Yeah everbody wear the mask but how long will it last
I thought he was the wonder, and I was stunned by his lips
Taking sips of an Amaretto sour with a twist
Shook my hips to the bass line, this joker grabbed my waistline
Putting pressure on my spine trying to get L-Boog to wind
I backed up off him then caught him with five finger to his face
I had to put him in his place
This kids invading my space
But then I recognized the smile, but I couldn't place the style
So many fronts in his mouth, I thought he was the Golden Child
Then it hit me that's Tariq from off the street around my Grams
I haven't seeen him since fifteen, when he got booked for doing scams
I tried to walk away but he wouldn't let me leave
He ran up quick behind me asking, ""Yo what happened to my nigga Steve?""
Steve was like this kid I went with back in Grammar School
I chuckled knucklehead I seen him yesterday he's cool
He's busted, ""so who you checking for now?""
Probably some intellectual
I kept the conversation straight and he kept trying to make it sexual
Then his old lady tried to play me waved her hands up in my face
Yo I told her check your man cause Bitch you acting out of place
M to the A to the S to the K
Put the mask upon me face just to make the next day
Brothers be frontin', then they be runnin'
I walk the street and camouflage my identity
My posse in the Bronx wear the mask
My crew on the Isle wear the mask
Stick up kids rollin' in the Omni wear the mask
Yeah everbody wear the mask but how long will it last?
3 A.M. in the morning on the Boulevard
I'm still at large engaged with my entourage
Me and Godfather and a 67 Dodge
I stepped out the note to post up my guard
Searching for my car that was stolen from Scotland Yard
My first instinct was to check the chop shop garage
As I rung the bell someone tapped me on my back
I turned around to look it was a rookie in a mask
He said, ""I got a itchin' on my trigger
Don't move nigga I'm taking you for murder.""
See cops got two faces like two laces on my Reeboks
My knees knock as I step back for a clearer shot
Well did you shoot him? Naw kid I didn't have the balls
That's when I realized I'm pumpin' too much Biggie Smalls
M to the A to the S to the K
Put the mask pon me face just to make the next day
Brothers be beefin', cops be thiefin'
Brothers be schemin', and should be teamin'
Jokers be smokin', and staying broke n

Niggas be creapin', baby mothers be weepin'

My crew in Jamaica wear the mask
Stick up kids bumping Fugee-La wear the mask

Tormentors climbed into my room
I crawled under my bed, covered my head
But they're flushin' me out with a broom

For my seeds or she'd be losin' her past
Time after time, she'd be readin' my mind
But she never got the feelin' to last
Celebrate, celebrate, celebraid it
This is the critical mass
So far so good, I heard the other say
So good so far, they're takin' me away
I drink to you, your mind, her ass
We'll take a drink and break the glass
Celebrate, celebrate, celebreak it
This is the critical mass
Now the tallest of two, with a brush full of blue
Paints surrealist scenes on the wall
So I tell her for fun, that it's really well done
But she just ain't listenin' at all
She points to my heart, tellin' me if I'm smart
I'll practice and phase
Out and admit, when the shoe doesn't fit
And I went screaming out down the hall
Need it
Need your love
Just then I heard a poundin' on the door
We're all here, sang the voice of twenty more
I drink to you alas, we'll take a drink and break the glass
Celebrate, celebrate, celebreak it
We are the critical mass

If only you had slept alone
If those seeds had not been sown
Oh you could come home and you would know that

And all you need
Is sitting here with you

I won't be hearing that sound anymore
And you and your sin
can leave the way you just came in
send my regards to her
I hope you've found that

The ornament she gave him still hangs from his Christmas tree
A jingle bell will glisten
That's when she loved to kiss him
So say farewell to all the little things she would say and do

Their words are not worth your life
Your success is the best revenge
Be different
D.P. Da Prophet
Live Forever Through Music (tag)
Hook 1: (Amber Kay)
Maybe it's the color of my skin
Maybe the style of my hair
Maybe it's the size of my clothes
Maybe the shoes I wear
But I'm different
I'm different
Maybe it's the way I walk
Walking on my own path cuz I'm different
Verse 1: (D.P. Da Prophet)
I'm different not talking 2 Chainz
Aint dissing telling the truth man
Know how it feel growing up
Never ever being the cool man
Not one day did they ever like me
Everyday wanted to fight me
Didn't wear Jordans or Nikes
Guess that made me invisible
Like I won't there non existent
So why they talk about me every minute
Fat boy fat boy bet they stop talking if fat boy killed them
They said they wish I die wonder how they feel if I really slit them
Many days I cried I'm a man can admit my feelings
Long nights, cold sweats, nightmares, death threats
No friends just leaches
This for the kids who sat in the bleachers
Never got to play the field or get they rep on
Feeling like a staircase always getting stepped on
I felt like a psyche ward should be my new home
Was cutting myself and punching walls
Thinking I should move on
Runaway, runaway, runaway and never come back
Maybe in another life huh they would love me
So I switched schools, everything was cool
For a few weeks, then it changed
When my new friends told me people
From my old school said I was lame
Now it's back to me all alone
Isolated pissed off
But in the end losers always become the rich ones
Hook 2: (Amber Kay)
Maybe it's the color of my skin
Maybe the style of my hair
Maybe it's the size of my clothes
Maybe the shoes I wear
But I'm different (I'm different I'm different)
I'm different (I'm different we different)
Maybe it's the way I walk
Walking on my own path cuz I'm different
Bridge: (D.P. Da Prophet & Amber Kay)
Don't be afraid to be different, be different, be different (Don't be afraid)
Don't be afraid to be different, be different, be different (To be different)
Don't be afraid to be different, be different, be different
Don't be afraid to be different... no
Verse 2: (D.P. Da Prophet)
No prom date so I didn't attend
No high school girlfriend
So I didn't learn how to love
Just lots of sex and drugs
No college applications cuz I thought it'll be worst
Than high school all the hating
Should of put my feet first
No remorse, no forgiveness
Just a cold heart getting colder
No happiness naw no joy
Just wishing my life was over
But I'm here to tell you
What I wish someone would of told me
Different's the new cool
Own it proudly"
56885	Rock	"What ya gonna do child when your thoughts are movin' slow?
Find another to show you where to go
You'll be searchin' for that train and you'll see it's a train
What ya gonna do child when your mommy goes away?
She won't take you, she'll leave you astray
You'll be searchin' for that train and you see it's a train
And you see yourself searchin' for somebody else
But you know for sure it's that train
What are you gonna do child when you leave it all behind?
Find another, to blow it in your mind
You'll be searchin' for that train and you'll see it's a train"
22716	Rock	"My pockets are empty
Fear's such a thief
You know how that goes
I used to think
You couldn't love a mess like me
Then You came in so close
As my heart settles
You do the impossible
You change me, You change me
Thank You, Jesus
I can see You change me
Like a bullet in a wound
It needs to be removed
But only by You, only by You
And though I feel so stuck
The hope in Your eyes is enough
To change me, You change me
Thank You, Jesus
I can see You change me
Now that I see Your face
I'll never be the same
You change me, You change me
Thank You, Jesus
I can see You change me"

My heart's in overdrive and you're behind the steering wheel
Touching you, touching me
Touching you, Ohh your touchin blue

Just listen to the rhythm of my heart
There's a chance we could make it now
We'll be rocking 'til the sun goes down
I believe in a thing called love
Ooh!
I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day
You got me in a spin but everything is A.OK!
Touching you, touching me
Touching you, Ohh your touchin blue

30280	Jazz	"Black day, stormy night
No love, no hope in sight
Don't cry, He is coming
Don't die without knowing the Cross
Ghettos to the left of us
Flowers to the right
There'll be bread for all of us
If we can just bear the Cross
Sweet songs of salvation
A pregnant mother sings
She lives in starvation
Her children need all she can bring
We all have our problems
Some are big, some are small
And soon all our problems
Will be taken by the Cross, by the Cross"
230607	Rock	"Way back yonder in the days of old
The men was working but not saving any dough
Then came a woman looking real cool
She said to herself, ""now that's my fool""
I'm gonna ball tonight
I'm gonna ball tonight
Well, I can't break the rule because
Every man is some woman's fool
I met a girl on the avenue
She was sharp and I was blue
Like a teacher and a student in the school
She looked at me and said, ""you're my fool""
I'm gonna ball tonight
Yes, I'm gonna ball tonight
Well, I can't break the rule because
Every man is some woman's fool
Way back yonder in the days of old
The men was working but not saving any dough
Then came a woman looking real cool
She began then to play every man for a fool
I'm gonna ball tonight
Yes, I'm gonna ball tonight
Well, there's no use to break the rules because
Every man is some woman's fool
Yeah, I'm gonna ball tonight
We're gonna ball tonight
We're gonna ball tonight
I'm gonna ball tonight
Well, there's no use to break the rules because
Every man is some woman's fool"
166607	Hip-Hop	"Compton's lynchin mutherfuckers with a left hook.
So turn the Eiht on 80 as I start to cook.
As my name stays terror when you're caught in the dark.
I punk bitches and kill off all scary marks.
So get a puff of the bomb ass Compton shit.
And watch the A double M pop in a second clip.
And when I'm all finished unloading,
I set the timer to 8 seconds, heads start exploding.
So punk get your shit in gear.
Say your prayers, your scared, as Mike brings up the rear.
Now your caught in a trap and you can't escape.
Made a bad mistake cause you dissed the Eiht.
You broke the penalty, punk start paying.
And your short, shorter then short, knowutumsaying?
So step back sorry clown, you ain't hitting.
You gets no juice, cause Compton's lynchin.
[Compton]..[no, please don't!]..[Now I'm lynchin mutherfuckers] X2.
Fools gang way, no time to play pussy.
Eiht is back to attack so don't push me.
don't try to play with my rhyme you can't stand this.
I'm from Compton so I don't give a fuck if you ban this.
I got you trapped in a mutherfuckin straight coat.
I guess you just can't talk with a clenched throat.
So punk don't try to bargain with your rhymes.
Playing me close will mean your crossing Eiht's line.
And that's not good for your health.
Cause when it comes to Eiht and Mike, you'll get dealt with.
The mutherfucking power after hour.
No air to breath, cause all the suckers we devour.
So hang up your dreams of making snaps.
You won't make a penny with your fucked up raps.
So step back or its your title I'm clinching.
Punk ass fool, cause Compton's lynchin
[Compton]..[no, please don't!]..[Now I'm lynchin mutherfuckers]
[Compton]..[Now wait a minute. Hey man]..[Now I'm lynchin
mutherfuckers]
[Compton]..[stop stop stop!]..[Now I'm lynchin mutherfuckers]
[Compton]..[Now I'm lynchin mutherfuckers]
I guess I'll start dropping these fools, cause they lyrics be like
offending me.
So you can say that Eiht's your worste enemy.
So make tracks or its your fucking hood I'll blow down.
One on one in the Compton streets we'll have a showdown.
And when it comes to Eiht its quite simple.
Pull the trigger, bullet smacks dead in your temple.
No explanations on why I did it.
When they ask, I tell em cause the punk bullshitted.
So now I leave his homeys in grief.
I can't just stand here and trip off a sucker who got beef.
And the Eiht ain't bullshitting G.
I got to kill off the sucker before the sucker gets me.
So raise the fuck up because the Eiht ain't tripping.
Before I let a sucker slide, he's already slipping.
And what's left is a sucker caught up in suspension.
Word em up G, cause Compton's lynchin.
[Compton]..[no, please don't!]..[Now I'm lynchin mutherfuckers]
[Compton]..[stop stop stop!]..[Now I'm lynchin mutherfuckers]
You give up? I see your sweating like crazy.
Eiht'll stay cool, cause fool you tried to phaze me.
Your rhymes are washed up your beats are fucked.
Your just a victim punk you'll get stuck.
By a brother with a evil vengence.
And when I say Eiht kills, boy I meant this.
And if your caught in the crossfire its like that.
I mean the shooting of lyrics or the damn gatt.
And geah, Eiht is back.
Teaming up with the Mike on the sneak attack.
So be prepared to get gaffled in the mix.
As my DJ Mike T fuck with the turntable tricks.
So take flicks, cause your all on his dick.
And its making me sick as he start to do a trick.
So raise the fuck up, its pieces of your brain that I'm pinchin.
Word em up G, Compton's lynchin.
[Compton]..[oh oh oh]..[get your ass up]..[whats up nigga]..[Now I'm
lynchin mutherfuckers]
[Compton]..[shit]..[punk ass nigga]..[now I'm lynchin mutherfuckers]
[Compton]..[surprise nigga]..[now I'm lynchin mutherfuckers]
[Compton]..[Compton's in the house]..[mutherfucker]
[Compton's in the house]..[mutherfuckers]

Big grin again, cheesy, don't be shy
Look Far, look far ahead
Never Lose, Never Lose!
Look Far, look far ahead

It's like we're wearing blinders
Same for the losers
This one is for the grinders
Put it all behind us
We're moving to the top
And we're never slacking off
Cause the bar can never stop
B.A and Deluxe
The two go together
Picking up the mic
You know we jam for whatever
Hand on the lever
Hand on the trigger
Picturing the crew falling off
How you figure
Always doing bigger
Ain't coming up small
But i keep an even keel
Cause its right before the fall
Telling all of y'all
Deluxe, Never Lose
Six million ways so its up for you to choose
And the rhyme chose me
Some would call it fate
Never looking back cause the slackers wanna hate
Never late with the rhyme
Always on time
Gotta stay with it
Everything is on the line"

Nobody knows his name.
He sat alone in a crowded room...
then he took the stage, did the crazy dance

She said, right now I'm gonna have

53304	Metal	"They measure him by his blood-shot eyes
They measure him by his thick disguise
Those nights of doubt and loneliness
Inside the thoughts never rest
The jest, the pomp and the circumstance
Won't fill the void nor soothe his sense
He wears his secret like a cloak
Truth makes it harder to cope
By the most enlightened matter
I'll have your mind in the grip of my hand
You despise what's on your platter
Wish for a change, dreams will have bound you
Make peace with all you ever knew
Make peace with all you ever do
Make peace with it all
I won't let you fall
Nailed down hope and with fingers crossed
Pick up the dreams that were nearly lost
Race for home and trusting arms
The antic has forsaken the farce
When they shake him awake again
Torn from the calm by a judging hand
The daylight's hard when the mind's not free
The circle starts over again
By the most enlightened matter
I have your mind in the grip of my hand
All he's done is try to bury
Fleeing so far from the judge and the jury"

I'm tired of being all alone
Got the TV on 'cause the radio's playing songs that remind me of you
Baby when you're gone I realize I'm in love
Days go on and on and the nights just seem so long
Even food don't taste that good, drink ain't doing what it should
Things just feel so wrong baby when you're gone
Yeah, I've been driving up and down these streets
Trying to find somewhere to go
Ya I'm lookin' for a familiar face but there's no one I know
Ah this is torture, this is pain
It feels like I'm gonna go insane
I hope you're coming back real soon 'cause I don't know what to do
Baby when you're gone I realize I'm in love
Days go on and on and the nights just seem so long
Even food don't taste that good, drink ain't doing what it should
Things just feel so wrong, baby when you're gone
Baby when you're gone I realize I'm in love

Heart I'm ashamed of you
Mind you let him drive me out of you
For you're made up to win his love somehow
Conscience ain't there something you can do
Cause if there is you'd better do it now
Heart I'm ashamed of you"

I have got you, deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin
I'd tried so, not to give in
And I said to myself this affair it never will go so well
But why should I try to resist when baby I know so well
That I've got you under my skin
I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear
Don't you know, you fool
You never can win
Use your mentality
Wake up to reality
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin
I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice comes in the night
And repeats how it yells in my ear
Don't you know, you fool
That ain't no just win
Why not use your mentality
Wake up, step up to reality
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Because I've got you under my skin
Yea, you grab me under my skin"

How many times have you tried
To mount the pieces of my broke-broken heart
Don't tell me everything's over
Don't take the sun from my eye
It's much too late to be alone
When our love grows old
And the flower gets cold
I will scream out, Should I leave
'Til there is no room to die
When the colors fade, on the what we've made
I will keep on trying, long after the flame is dying
Too late, too long to mention
Too wide to keep it inside
This revelation of my wound-wounded self
You are the wind of adventure
You are the sun in my eye
You are the one who keeps me whole
When our love grows old
And the flower gets cold
I will scream out, Should I leave
'Til there is no room to die
When the colors fade, on the what we've made

Tonight is for dreamers

Look around, it's everywhere

Hear the wind pass through the trees

I knew that we would connect
Your eyes had told me that somehow
We shared a history
Feeling fearless I took a chance
Couldn't let the moment pass
I felt that fate had played a hand
And brought you here to me
But happiness can be short-lived
And pain can bring you to your knees
[Chorus:]
Don't think, that I'll get over you
Don't know, if I can make it through
My darkest days without you in my life and i
Don't think, that I can face the pain
I'll never see your face again
I close my eyes and wonder when
Will it ever end
Get as close as we could be
Felt that you could see through me
You read my mind you knew my life
Became a part of me
Took for granted precious time
Thought we had it on our side
By some cruel twist of fate
I had to watch you fade away"

When there's one day here and the next day gone

Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate break down the garden gate
There's not much left today
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Through all the cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
Knock me down get back up again
You're in my blood I'm not a lonely man
There's no load I can't hold
Road so rough this I know
I'll bee there when the light comes in
Tell 'em we're survivors
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long

A misunderstanding once but now
We look it in the eye
There's no load, I can't hold
Road so rough this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Tell 'em we're survivors

Is she coming round for me once again, around or was that just the end
I just hope she's coming round again
I've been keeping myself busy with my books and with my tapes
Every day's much better since I've slowed my drinking pace
There's no swimming in the bottle it's just someplace we all drown
I lost myself in sorrow lost my confidence in doubt
Is she coming 'round for me once again, around or was that just the end
I just hope she's coming round again
Get in the car and drive through town
Down the block and back around
Pretending that she's there with me we drive
Gone forever
My patience keeps me plaintive my high hopes keep me alone
My lover's will is shaken I wish she would just come home
So tell me Mrs. Rita what's it say in my tarot
Read my palm and tell me why do lovers come and go
Is she coming round for me once again, around or was that just the end

As the angels did bathe me with heaven again

Which direction we are going

So the danger must be growing
I draw inspiration from the micro dreams
That twitch the body before the entering
We pull ourselves into a callous induced sleep
Swallowed by the years of undigested beatings
In this place you reek of fear
Deserved malaise
Light is gone with shedding grace
And God has backed away

Made me foster hatred and made me want to make it
When I'm in the Bay niggas say (Del, how you doin, man?)
I ain't no rap star that act hard, can't speak
I leak lyrics, freak lyrics, secrete lyrics
From my spirits
Tyranny for all who hear of me
Bomb in a bong, my feet in a thong
On a beach with a biatch named Bonbon
Called her on the Intercong, enter John Owens
Better known as Casual to y'all not knowin'
About flowin, cause your rhymes are all stolen
Another dip on the strip cause task force patrollin'
But rollin' blunts too fat to measure
Mexico's national treasure for pleasure
Resurrect tracks like this from my childhood
Before it was such a wild hood
Knock on wood
[Chorus]
My beats are meaty
Let's call a peace treaty
And stick to it
I'm quick to do it, are you?
So much funk you can't kick it with my crew
Other than when it's time to get blue?
(Shame on you)
I want me a girl that's intelligent
Doin' shit and ain't too belligerent
Picture it, chillin' backyard barbecue
Not trippin' off what niggas are to you
Jealousy, well let's see
It's a lot of that in Oakland
It started when niggas started smokin'
And snortin' hop, fuck pop
I want the melodies
But not the weak topics you are selling me
Del is free of confinements
My mind bendin' fragile and frazzled
I choose to stay underground like Fraggles
In battles I'm sure to win
While you smoke bud I drink gin
It sinks in while everyone else act on it
I macked on it but not too far from redrum
Don't push me, I'm not a pussy
I wish we could gather at a function, drink some lager
And just bust hymns of funk and flav
'Cause the slaves that are our ancestors
Would feel blessed if we did that
Before we hear rap
Now it's American children syntax
Ever since it been on wax
And that's the facts, believe it, don't mislead it
And don't do the shit if you don't need it
And that's real, you might not be but I am
The truth's gonna slap you in the face, so why scam?
[Chorus]"

Chemical trips and I can face you
Chemical tricks and the bullshits gone
Burn man, burn, burn it all

But build my world besides you
Watching you draw a line
Some say you are, you are
Just like a butterfly
Whose broken wings will spread
To softly feel your mood
Over the blue sky full of you
Pink love, pink love, pink love
Just like a fairytale
My only reason naturally
Starts to get to me
Pushing my way through
Mesh of life
I want to kiss the sickness of mind
My heart without reason
Sunken to deep disappointment
Spreads over universe
With a knife
I want to bleed out distress like this
It's not just a fairytale
It's painted by me
It's not just loneliness between you and I
If on magic mountain you find you can breath
Then stay and don't look back
To the blue woven sky
Storms of petals are pouring down
Pushing their way through our pink love
So many polka dots painted by me
Spreads over universe for you
And I, I want to kiss
Pink love, pink love
I want to kiss
Pink love, pink love
In my mind
I state myself
The clock is ticking without you
Some may say illness
So called so called love
The sickness of mind
It's not just a fairytale
It's painted by me
It's not just loneliness between you and I
If on magic mountain you find you can breath
Then stay and don't look back
To the blue woven sky
Storms of petals are pouring down
Pushing their way through our pink love
So many polka dots painted by me
Spreads over universe for you
And I, I want to kiss
Pink love, pink love
I want to kiss
Pink love, pink love"

And since you've found someone new I think it's best
I don't cry and walk the floor I don't love you anymore
Trouble is I don't love you anyless
I don't love you anymore for I've got no more love to give
You drained my heart of all its love with every sweet caress
I keep saying o'er and o'er I don't love you anymore
Trouble is I don't love you anyless

I held you close to me one time I kissed your lips and called you mine
But another came and thrilled you more I guess
I cried as you walked out the door I don't love you anymore
Trouble is I don't love you anyless
I don't love you anymore...

The one his producer thinks he never shoulda made
But it gets me going, gets me into the shower
What a shock to be awake at this early hour
And you're gone
It was time to fly
And all that's left
Is the fact we tried
So thanks for the tunes
And thanks for the time
You're gone now
Baby bye bye
Them guys from Orange County, man, do they wail?
Shakes my brain and it shakes my tail
New girl on top of me, will this work out?
I retreat to the kitchen and sort it all out
And you're gone
You left your keys on the table
And on the bed you left a rose
And a note that said, ""My CD's won't fit in the car
You can keep 'em I s'pose""
This disc was left out in the sun, it's warped and it's hissing
I can't place the voice and the insert's missing
I turn off the phone so if you don't call it's all right
And maybe I won't listen to nothing tonight
And you're gone"

I must be problematic.
I must be problematic.
I must be problematic.
If you don't dress right,

If you don't lose weight,

And I just want to leave.
Can no longer take it

Just keep me in the bedroom

and the scent from the petals of the flowers fills the room but you are not here.
On the velvet sofa as the dreams that turned to ashes quietly
I watch a local movie. The reason to laugh is seeing you on screen.
The moon-shaped lamp still shines red.
Goodbye... My to my dearest Vivian-scented girl.
The decorations of perfumes in the sink, the black and white picture cries.
What you see is everything and there's no reason to that.
Cut down your discomfort wings.
It's dying on you.
Cut down your discomfort wings.
To a tomorrow that can't be reached.
Children sing the church choir at the newly built church.
When ever I walk past it, my heart screams.
There's no forgetting the Past, the Present, or the Future.
Will only the believers be led to salvation? That's stupid.
Why can't we be perfect? Why can't it be?
The merry go round that goes around and around and around has dried you up.
I hold in my sweaty hand, a picture of you and an ice pick.
Cut down your discomfort wings.
Be freer.
Cut down your discomfort wings.
But keep the door closed."

I'm tryna move in my safe, like the safe was a safehouse
I ain't going out to eat, but these hoes stay on the stakeout
And you know it's official when I go bringing that Bape out
I'm thumbing through the magazines like ""this the girl I'mma take out""
Imagine stuck in the D and you tryna find a way way out
And yeah, your music been bumping and you just waiting to break out
And I've been waiting all God damn year, all year
I can tell that it's near, but near ain't here
Man, them bills is here right now
I guess you shine brightest when the lights down, like now
And then they say it happened for me overnight, shit, yeah I guess
I guess it took ten years for me to be an overnight success
What you know about living check to check to living check to check to check to check?
First place, no neck and neck
Two girls is breast to breast to breast to breast
Blowing smoke but I'm a breath of fresh air
Yeah, saying I'm doing extra numbers like I'm Chinese
Taking double shots like Siamese
I'm from where crime breeds, her titties out like sign these
I knew I lived this life back when I was young and used to climb trees
I should've known back then I wasn't gonna stop
'Cause even then I was infatuated with just sitting at the top
I said I should've known back then, man, that I wasn't gonna stop
'Cause even then I was infatuated with just sitting at the top

Tryna get paid repeatedly
Jamaica or Cancun, now that's where I need to be
Credit card used to be EBT, in the D though that's D-EBT
I be thinking about becoming a cop
So I can murk some niggas one by one off legally
I talk that real shit, but that's why they loving it
One time for the city, treating it like it's the mother ship
Was talking to my dad though on some other shit
He like ""man, slow down with the girls you're fucking with
If they ain't a quarter back, there's no point of rushing it
Don't make the same mistakes I made with your mother""
But that's on some other shit, look
I'm into risk and taking it
I'm into making it then back then make it like I ain't made it yet
This the rehab for a workaholic, I been thinking bout shaking it
I done had a Rolex longer than I had relationships, I'm embarrassed to say that shit
But I've been working on myself and that's the most important work
Even if you don't get paid for it
Shit, call me the greatest
Don't call up no favours, I call up my saviour

And now we headed to the tallest skyscrapers"

Yeah kiss where it stings c'mon show me a time
But when you talk in code and you talk in signs
Wave those hands
And you flash those eyes
I don't understand when you blind me with science
You talk in code
Talking keep talkin'
Decipher me now
Describe me an arc with a low point or two
Ah cough me a code
Astonish me dear with a new point of view
Yes it's all in your hands
The Wristwatch Frisco is in action again
Ah well I like you I think
It varies so much sometimes it really depends on
If you talk in code...etc.
And then if A = B
Sometimes what you say isn't all that it seems
And if C = 3
Inscrutable view with a new slant on things
Ah semaphore girl

But you're talking in code
I don't understand but I won't make a scene

And wonder where it might lead

Many a dream we will share
Many's the time we will gladly take
The long way there
With every step
We will draw closer
With every turn
Our love will grow
Take my hand
We have many a mile to go
True love is not
A destination but
One day we will arrive
This is the journey
We will be taking
The rest of our lives
Many a mile we will travel
There will be days that we're missing
All the places our love has been
There will be joy in knowing the best
Is still around the bend
With every step
We will draw closer
With every turn
Our love will grow
Take my hand
We have many a mile to go
Oh, take my hand
We have many a mile to go
Many a mile to go"

The mob had moved their goal
And then they went straight for it 'cos they act like sheep
You watched it fall apart
Then you woke up one morning and the rules had changed
You let them break your heart
But now you they look right through you like you're so deranged it's
Geektime Freaktime
You're lost in the crowd without a clue
It's not that much to say
There should still be some way
That you can make it through
You start to feel that chill
I know you don't deserve it but you're in disgrace
A case of wait until
You can regain perspective and rejoin their race
So they can't understand
You spend your whole day pleading that you did no wrong
That it's not what you planned
You never set your stall out and you don't belong in ....
Don't let them make you quit
Or say you must accept this as the only way
Cos they're just full of it
They never spent one minute never spent one day in..."

You be all in your feelings 'bout it
Like ""when I see him I'mma kill this nigga""
I'm on three-way like, ""you hear this nigga?""
I should take the bitch back and clip the nigga
Pussy make him not pay attention
You punk bitch go with this nigga
I throw bands, bitch, these hoes love me
I fuck a bad bitch 'till she ugly
Put the pussy in recovery
I'm like, ""now what you think of me?""

Blowin' big bankrolls on clothes
Now they wonder where the money at
Yeah, the motherfucking money that they had from the re-up gone

I fell asleep on paper wings.
These people have no feelings
their heads are the only things that ever teach them anything about love.
And I'm not sad, I just want to trust someone so badly.
I just want something beautiful to happen here right now.

And who knew I'd be on Hulu with two dudes I used to Google
I'm frugal with time, every girl's a dime
When your bank account's mine...
We Just Say ""Fuku Burger""

You can be with me and I can be with you
A god above, another one below
You better run baby now you'll never know
I got a dream do you want to be in my dream?
I got a dream do you want to be in my dream?
I got a tender heart do you want my tender heart?
I got nothin' you need and everything you want
You make your bed honey
I'll clean your nose
Roll over once why don't you
Shake out those pretty clothes
I got a tender heart
Do you want my tender heart?
I got a tender heart
Do you want my tender heart?
First time I saw you I thought
I must have dreamed you up
You laughed in my face and
Threw down in a paper cup
The ice is melting, it's melting in the sink
It's only four, why don't you
Make us one more drink?
I got a dream do you want to be in my dream?
I got a dream do you want to be in my dream?
Do you want to be in my dream?
Do you want to be in my dream?
Do you want to be in my dream?
Do you want to be in my dream?"
13009	Rock	"Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
It's a hard and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin'
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warnin'
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin'
Heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin'
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall
Who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman whose body was burning
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded in hatred
It's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall
Oh, what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin'
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
The executioner's face is always well hidden
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten
Where black is the color and none is the number
And I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it
Reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin'
But I'll know my song well before I start singin'
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall
It's a hard rain's a gonna fall
It's a hard rain's a gonna fall"

It's in the way that you use it,
It comes and it goes.
It's in the way that you use it,
Boy don't you know.
And if you lie you will lose it,
Feelings will show.
So don't you ever abuse it,
Don't let it go.
Nobody's right till somebody's wrong.
Nobody's weak till somebody's strong.
No one gets lucky till luck comes along.
Nobody's lonely till somebody's gone.
[Chorus: x2]
And if you lie you will lose it,
Feelings will show.
So don't you ever abuse it,
Don't let it go.

Walked on some thin ice, never like this.
I've told you white lies, never like this.
Looked into true eyes, never like this.

Breaking all the laws of the land
Well don't you try to stop me

And that's the way I'm sure she had it planned
Well that's my Rock-and-roll Madonna
She's always been a lady of the road
Well everybody wants her
But no one ever gets her
Well the freeway is the only way she knows
Well if she would only slow down for a short time
I'd get to know her just before she leaves
But she's got some fascination for that two wheel combination
And I swear it's going to be the death of me"

She don't ever move until I say so
Her only purpose in life is get me large
I got my pen workin' 16 bars
When I'm happy she happy, sad she sad
She make sure we both have
She know I got plenty more to replace her
Bitch better have mine
I'm not lettin' no pen get out of line
You did it, I mean, can you dig it
She committed to me, she please niggas for me
My shit's so tight she leave a nigga for me
I met her in a studio, she caught my eye
With her over kickin' whack ass rhymes
I needed a pen, so she let me borrow her
Like my shit ain't ill enough to overpower her
I see he wasn't treatin' her right
So I gave her some paper
And let her do her thing that night
that's right, I took it from that player
He to concerned with his money and his pager
She told me, shit he be kickin' is so weak
I told him, your hoe chose me I'm goldie
Be cool, or we can make the heat come out
Your pen work for me 'till the ink run out (player)

My rap is uncut raw, out the door
Type shit to have fiends lookin' for more
Your rap is lactose; you cooled off, the glass broke
Customers complainin' never comin' back yo
My rap flow is pure all white, in the hood all night
You made your first sale when I sold out
My shit numbs your whole mouth, yours leaves a foul taste
My rhymes a felony yours never seen a trial date
You need a legal aid, my pen got the DA's paid
My flows sleepin' in a cave
No day's I got the streets in this mad
You need a mask to repair the ? here
You see the glass once I flip this track
You should see my stash, I got rhymes for days
Fuck a right front page, I stay deliverin, ain't no middle men
I never short my man or cross my fans
Or switch my supply when money cross my hand
It's funny, I'm here, I'm like the crew I used to roll wit'
You might as well work for me, I got the clientele
y'all put to much cred in that stuff you tred to sell
that's the reason your empire fell like Goliath
I'm supplyin' the ghetto to satisfy you
Marks, NARC's, is analiyzin' why this kid
Crossed the bridge and came through with platinum shinin'
Bringin' heat to the street like I had the iron

I never ever saw the stars above
My world was empty and cold
Never had somebody to hold
I was alone and drifting out to sea
I needed someone who could rescue me
I couldn't find my own way
Couldn't tell the night from the day
The one day you appeared just like a dream
And now I know what happiness can mean
* So glad you came into my life - What a feeling
I thank the stars for all the love we're sharing
So glad you came into my life - What a feeling
I never dreamed I'd find a love like yours and mine
I was afraid and just too blind to see
I never thought that love was meant for me
I couldn't let it begin
Didn't think that I'd ever win
I had no dreams - I had no fantasy
My heart was always under lock and key
I couldn't let myself go
Now it seems so long ago
And now my life is better every day
I never knew that love could feel this way

I'm hoping that it's not just my imagination
I'm praying that it's not just your infatuation
And now my life is better every day

A little closer to the keyboard
It's hard to read between your lines
We were the clock hands at midnight
Now you're four whole hours behind
Just put your fingers
A little closer to the keyboard
I can't quite see the whites of your eyes
Though you bat your eyelids from across the ocean
And I fall over in their breeze
I don't bring you spices from the East
And I don't bring you the world's you crave
'cause everyday you need a new one
Just like Mr. Benn
Just like Mr. Benn
Just like Mr. Benn
Put your sweet fingers
A little closer to the keyboard
We pass light bits in the night
Though you send your flare to the horizon
I just stare and blink in your light
No, I don't speak in all your tongues
So I don't even know if I'll be welcome
What if I appeared as if by magic?
Just like in Mr. Benn
Just like Mr. Benn
Just like Mr. Benn
So go if you're going
You keep pouring when I say when
Come home when your work there is done
Just like, just like
Just like Mr. Benn

We just left the city, left it far behind
Silhouettes of palm trees, airplanes cross the moon
Living in the moment of the girl who left too soon
It's warm, my favorite song comes on
Let's roll the windows down and drive
It feels like summer is a comin' round the corner
Here she comes
Brings us shells that listen to what we have to say
Blows us summer kisses as she turns and walks away
There she goes, there she goes
Drive right on, the night is young
We could drive on and on forever as the hours slip on by
They slip like perfect fitting sweaters
Over shoulders cold from shortened days and wintry nights
Left me in September, I thought that she was gone
Invited her to come again, so she could tag along
Barefoot on the pavement
Warm against our feet
Houses filled with music
As we drift through lonely streets"

You stand beside me through all seasons
You clean up my face, you fill up my space
With white linen and syringes
Out on the road you carry my load
Make it lighter when I feel weak
And when i am blind you crawl in my mind
And make me wiser than I could ever be alone
I know it ain't easy
I know it's getting harder for you
I know it ain't easy
But these are the roads that we choose
When I make a mess you wash and you dress me
When I'm wired you talk me down
When I'm a fool you're calm and you're cool
I never want for anything when you're around
When I'm in your bed, all you ever do
Is treat me with respect, but I don't know how
I know It ain't easy
Yes, I know it's getting harder for you
I know it ain't easy
But these are the roads that we choose
Though I've made some big mistakes
You don't complain at all
Even when you come and find me
Crying like a baby
Standing up in the bathtub
Whenever I'm hurt, you are my nurse
You stand beside me through all seasons
You're patient when I'm slow, warm when I'm cold
You're everything I'm not, you know everything I don't
I know it ain't easy
I know it's getting harder for you
I know it ain't easy
But these are the roads that we choose
These are the roads that we choose
These are the roads that we choose"
311813	Metal	"Mirties ranka tamsi
Kyla auktyn auktyn
Koks tu altas esi
Umerktom akim.
Nesuprantam, ar tu dar velgi
Ar tik klausti mgintum,
Ar tik rodai mums i toli
K paslpti tikt.
Noris paslpti tavy
Tai kas ms yra
Kol aki pramerkt negali
Ir kol esam alia."
173252	Metal	"It is cold out here
and lonely is my journey
I walk the trail of broken souls
the darkest path through infinity
far behind my body rot
for me no more tomorrow
fear or pain I know not
and yet I am filled with sorrow
I am at the gates
Lord of chaos
let me sleep
space is deep
Lord of chaos...
through the gates the journey goes on
the fate of my immortal soul
through the gates the journey goes on and on...
All I crave is to sleep
All I crave is to sleep
Across the seas without no name
the weak spot of the creation
My crown of thorns all life it drains
as the sears back of my mind
but at the side of my lake
insanity wait for me to find
I am all as I am you and me
I am everything and will forever be
a part of your throughout eternity
when you die you too will be
heaven waits below as you will see
I am at the the gates but where are the keys
all I crave is to sleep
all I crave is to sleep
lord of chaos..."
267554	Rock	"Emma appeared like an angel.
Emma fell like rain
Into my lap like a heart attack.
Like lightning from her name
I'm running dry of bad excuses.
Don't want to lie or seem intrusive, but
Time hasn't told me anything,
And neither has she
A poinsettia in poison rain...
Traded true love for insult and injury
We washed it down the drain with
One silver bullet and two vicodin
Emma woke up in darkness,
Suitcase already packed
Note on the bedstand signed in blood,
""sincerely, never coming back.""
A nightmare on my street the day she arrived
A nightmarish household in which she died,
'cause it made her feel at home
Somehow made me feel at home
A poinsetta in poison rain...
Traded true love for insult and injury
We washed it down the drain with
One wooden stake through the heart, and two vicodin"
154034	Rock	"This is our west coast
At beck and call
And I won't ask for more
You can't believe it
until you come
you'll be lost at words
I can lie and swear I hate this land
But I need this blow of fresh air
There is a treasure everywhere you go
But in the west coast even time turns gold
You can't deny yourself to ride these endless nights
This is our west side and you can bet
that you won't ask for more
This makes me feel like it's my perfect world
that I grew fond of
I can lie and swear I hate this land
But I need this blow of fresh air
There is a treasure everywhere you go
But in the west coast even time turns gold
You can't deny yourself to ride these endless nights
There is a song for everywhere you go
It's the west coast that we're singing for
You can't deny yourself to ride these endless nights
You're always in time
It's never too late to go to the west
I'm feeling so right
I'm in the prime of my life
Though it's not L.A.
I can lie and swear I hate this land
But I need this all
I can lie and swear I hate this land
But I need this blow of fresh air
There is a treasure everywhere you go
But in the west coast even time turns gold
You can't deny yourself to ride these endless nights
There is a song for everywhere you go
It's the west coast that we're singing for
You can't deny yourself to ride these endless nights"
